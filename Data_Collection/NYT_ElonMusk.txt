" AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - The most powerful operational rocket in the world, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, launched its first commercial mission on Thursday from Florida in a key demonstration for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company in the race to grasp lucrative military launch contracts.The 23-story-tall Heavy, which previously launched Musk’s cherry red Tesla roadster to space in a 2018 debut test flight, blasted off from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center carrying its first customer payload.""T plus 33 seconds into flight, under the power of 5.1 million pounds of thrust, Falcon Heavy is headed to space,"" SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said on a livestream. Roughly three minutes after clearing the pad, Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the core rocket for a synchronized landing at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, sparking boisterous cheers from SpaceX engineers in the company's Hawthorne, California headquarters.  The middle booster, after pushing the payload into space, returned nearly 10 minutes later for a successful landing on SpaceX's seafaring drone ship 400 miles (645 km) off the Florida coast. In the 2018 test mission, Heavy's core booster missed the vessel and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. “The Falcons have landed” Musk wrote on Twitter, inaugurating the first successful recovery of all three rocket boosters, which will be refurbished and re-fly in another Falcon Heavy mission this summer to carry a swarm of military and science satellites for the Air Force.Liftoff with Heavy’s new military-certified Falcon 9 engines was crucial in the race with Boeing-Lockheed venture United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin as Musk’s SpaceX, working to flight-prove its rocket fleet one mission at a time, aims to clinch a third of all U.S. National Security Space missions - coveted military contracts worth billions.The U.S. Air Force tapped SpaceX in 2018 to launch for $130 million a classified military satellite and in February added three more missions in a $297 million contract. SpaceX and Boeing Co are vying to send humans to space from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, atop a Falcon 9 rocket, cleared its first unmanned test flight in March ahead of its crewed mission planned for July, while the first unmanned test for Boeing’s Starliner capsule is slated for August on ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket. Falcon Heavy carried a communications satellite for Saudi-based telecom firm Arabsat, which will beam internet and television services over Africa, Europe and the Middle East.Privately owned SpaceX, also known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, was founded in 2002 by Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla Inc.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersNEW YORK — Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will get another week to settle a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter, a federal judge ruled Thursday. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan extended the deadline by one week to April 25, in response to a Thursday court filing where both sides requested the extension and said ""discussions are ongoing."" Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet that the SEC said violated an earlier settlement with the agency.If Musk and the agency fail to resolve the dispute, the judge said she would rule on the contempt request. The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk's privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company, including tweets.In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.Musk's lawyers have argued that the tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.At an April 4 hearing, a lawyer for the SEC said that if Musk were found in contempt, the agency would ask the judge to require him to submit regular reports about his Twitter use, and to pay a series of progressively higher fines for any future violations.Nathan declined to rule on the contempt motion at the hearing, instead ordering Musk and Tesla to meet and try to resolve the dispute on their own.Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. He has been chief executive of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.The Palo Alto, California-based company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.The Feb. 19 tweet that prompted the SEC's contempt motion said: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" meaning 500,000 vehicles.Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be ""probably around"" 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.Musk's lawyers have argued that the first tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission.""In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight.""

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteTesla delivered fewer vehicles than expected in the first quarter, the company said Wednesday, with deliveries falling 31 percent to 63,000 vehicles from the fourth quarter of 2018.The electric-car maker, led by Elon Musk, said the lower-than-expected delivery volume and several pricing adjustments would hurt its first-quarter net income. The company previously said it would lose money in the first quarter.The company’s shares were down about 8 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday.The price cuts were aimed at making Tesla cars affordable to a wider range of customers. The cost to consumers was essentially increased on Jan. 1 when a federal tax credit available to buyers of electric vehicles was cut in half, to $3,750, as part of a scheduled phaseout of the incentive. The credit will drop to $1,875 after July 1 and end next Jan. 1.The drop in deliveries appeared to reflect new weakness in demand in the United States, occurring even though Tesla began shipping cars in volume to Europe and China in the quarter. Deliveries of its Model 3 sedan, its most affordable car, totaled 50,900, 20 percent fewer than in the fourth quarter. Deliveries of its Model S and Model X luxury models fell 56 percent to 12,100 cars.[Hints of the slump were evident in registration data.]Tesla produced 77,100 vehicles in the quarter, down from 86,555 in the fourth quarter. It reiterated that it expected to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, and said it had finished the quarter with “sufficient” cash on hand, without offering further details. Analysts have raised concerns about Tesla’s cash supply. It started the first quarter with $3.7 billion, but used nearly $1 billion to make a payment to bondholders last month.Next month, Tesla hopes to begin volume deliveries of a $35,000 version of the Model 3, the car that many of the company’s fans have been waiting for. Analysts are uncertain whether Tesla can make money selling the Model 3 at that price, however.In a Feb. 28 conference call, Mr. Musk said Tesla would close most of its stores around the country and rely on online sales as part of an effort to slash costs so it could sell the $35,000 car profitably. But 11 days later, Tesla reversed course and said it would keep many of the stores, and reopen some that had already closed. It also said it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3.In the coming weeks, Tesla is expected to report a loss for the first quarter. The company was profitable in the final two quarters of 2018 as Model 3 sales rose.There have been other challenges for the company, including a renewed legal battle between Mr. Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The S.E.C. asked a federal court in February to hold Mr. Musk in contempt for violating a settlement that he and Tesla reached with the commission last year regarding scrutiny of his statements. In a motion to the court, the S.E.C. said Mr. Musk had not sought approval from company lawyers, as required by the agreement, before making a sales prediction on Twitter that varied from previous announcements. The court is expected to rule on Thursday.In the tweet, which was posted Feb. 19, Mr. Musk said Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year, 100,000 more than the company had forecast in January. Tesla’s general counsel left the company two days later.In response, Mr. Musk’s lawyers said the commission was overreaching based on comparable precedents. They contend that Mr. Musk was acting within his discretion in his Twitter posting, and that it contained no material information beyond what the company had previously stated in public.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. Boudette and Raymond ZhongTesla has unveiled a compact sport utility vehicle called the Model Y, in its latest effort to broaden its product range while contending with problems on a number of fronts.Speaking on Thursday night at an event at the company’s design center in Hawthorne, Calif., Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, touted the new electric vehicle’s performance and safety-focused design.“It has the functionality of an S.U.V., but it will ride like a sports car,” Mr. Musk said. “This thing will be really tight in corners. And we expect it will be the safest midsize S.U.V. in the world by far.”Tesla, however, is still a long way from delivering the vehicle. It forecast that the earliest deliveries would begin in fall 2020, barring engineering or production delays of the sort that hampered its best-selling car, the Model 3.Last year, Mr. Musk predicted that the Model Y would be ready for delivery in the first half of 2020. Tesla has not offered detailed plans for assembling the car, and recently said it would probably make the Model Y at its giant battery plant in Nevada.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Tesla’s goal of having the Model Y in volume production by the end of next year was a matter of concern.“This timeline appears similar to the original timeline for the Model 3 ramp, which was ultimately delayed by nine-12 months,” he wrote in a note to investors.By late 2020, Tesla will probably face stronger competition. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Porsche are just starting to produce vehicles that will rival the Model Y.The first Model Y versions will have starting prices of $47,000 to $60,000 and are expected to offer a driving range of up to 300 miles. The company has begun taking deposits of $2,500 for orders.A more affordable version with a range of about 230 miles and a starting price of $39,000 is supposed to go into production in spring 2021.Tesla said it aimed to offer the Model Y in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other European countries.Investors seemed unimpressed by the rollout. Tesla’s shares declined 5 percent on Friday.Tesla is confronting sales challenges in Europe and China, markets it has been counting on for expansion. The company has also faced some operational uncertainty. Two weeks ago, Mr. Musk announced that Tesla would begin selling a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan priced at $35,000, $8,000 less than the cheapest current version. But he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, and analysts question whether Tesla can ever make money on the car at the lower price.Tesla originally said customers would have to wait two to four weeks for delivery of the $35,000 Model 3. It now says the wait is six to eight weeks because of the volume of orders.Sales of Tesla’s other models, the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, have been flattening. And analysts suspect that demand for Tesla vehicles has softened since the beginning of the year, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers fell by half, raising the total cost for buyers. Until the end of 2018, Tesla buyers were eligible for a credit of $7,500. That fell to $3,850 on Jan. 1, essentially raising the price of Tesla cars.Tesla responded with a series of price cuts to lift sales. In a conference call in January, Mr. Musk said many customers could not afford the company’s cars.To cut costs, Tesla announced that it would close most of its stores around the country. Days later, it backtracked and decided to keep many of the stores, and to reopen some that had already closed, though it affirmed a shift toward online-only sales. It also reversed direction on pricing, saying it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the production plans for Tesla’s Model Y. The company said it would be available in North America, parts of Europe, and China; it did not say the car would be produced in all of those places.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteJust days after saying that it would close most of its stores, Tesla is making an abrupt U-turn.In a message posted on its blog just before midnight Sunday, the electric-car maker said it had decided to retain many of the locations it had shut down or was planning to close. And it said it would raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide, just weeks after cutting prices.“Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,” the company said in the blog post. The price increases, it said, are necessary to make up for the loss of savings that was anticipated from the store closings.The flip-flops are the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk.“This reversal is bizarre and indicates a lack of actual planning in the earlier announcement,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst. “Their retail stores still serve a real need.”Until last month, Tesla had been rushing to expand its network of showrooms and mall galleries, which display its cars but take no customer orders.On Feb. 28, Mr. Musk told reporters in a conference call that Tesla would start offering a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan with a starting price of $35,000. Previously, the least expensive Model 3 cost $43,000 before tax incentives.Mr. Musk said closing its stores would allow Tesla to cut costs enough to make the Model 3 profitable at the lower price. But he would not elaborate on those calculations, and he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, contrary to previous forecasts.As part of the cost cutting, he said, Tesla would henceforth take orders only online. Tesla affirmed the online approach in its announcement Sunday night, saying its stores would serve as a way to introduce potential buyers to Tesla vehicles, provide a test drive on request — another reversal from its earlier announcement — and show how to make a purchase.“Stores will also carry a small number of cars in inventory for customers who wish to drive away with a Tesla immediately,” it added.In a recent email to employees, Mr. Musk said 78 percent of Model 3 orders were already placed online. Buyers can get full refunds if they return cars within seven days and have driven them less than 1,000 miles.Tesla has been in retreat in recent months, scrambling to shore up flagging investor confidence. Along with layoffs of 7 percent of its work force in January, the news of store closings appeared to underline the challenges for a newcomer breaking into an old-line manufacturing industry. The company has struggled to make a few thousand cars in a week — a feat that established automakers can do in a day.Asked to elaborate on the company’s latest moves, a Tesla spokesman declined to comment.The weeks of tension have taken a toll on Tesla shares. On Monday they rose 2.4 percent, closing at $290.92, but they are down 9 percent since Mr. Musk said the company would be unprofitable in the first quarter.The twists on the marketing front have coincided with renewed upheaval surrounding Mr. Musk himself.Less than a month ago, Tesla’s general counsel quit a day after Mr. Musk said on Twitter that the company expected to sell 500,000 cars this year, an increase of 100,000 from the estimate it made public in January.The Securities and Exchange Commission contended that the tweet violated an agreement it had reached with Tesla in September to settle a securities-fraud case, and it asked a federal court to hold Mr. Musk in contempt. Under the settlement, the company was to “put in place additional controls and procedures” to oversee Mr. Musk’s communications.In a response filed with the court on Monday, Mr. Musk’s lawyers argued that there were no grounds for a contempt citation. They said that the Tesla chief “correctly used his discretion” to determine that nothing in his Twitter post was material and that “under no fair reading of the materiality standard” did the post alter the information available to investors.The response also said that a contempt citation “would raise serious First Amendment issues” and that the S.E.C.’s request represented “unprecedented overreach.”Even with its financial and regulatory challenges, the company is moving ahead on new initiatives.On Thursday, Mr. Musk is scheduled to unveil the Model Y, a sport utility vehicle that Tesla is counting on to fuel further growth. David Whiston, a Morningstar analyst, said the big question for Tesla’s business prospects was when the Model Y would be available for sale. “Thursday is just for show,” he said.And in a move meant to address its logistical challenges in delivering cars to customers, Tesla said in a filing with the S.E.C. on Monday that it had purchased trucks and car-hauling trailers from a California company in exchange for stock worth $13.8 million. In November, Mr. Musk said on Twitter that Tesla had bought “some trucking companies,” but provided no details.Mr. Musk has portrayed the Model 3 as a mass-market offering crucial to Tesla’s future. In the last three months of 2018, Tesla opened 27 sales and service locations to keep up with rising demand. Over all, the company had more than 100 stores and showrooms in the United States, and others overseas.In its announcement Sunday night, Tesla said it had already closed 10 percent of its locations. Those stores did not have “natural foot traffic,” it said, though some will reopen with a smaller staff. The company said an additional 20 percent were under review for potential closing in the coming months.The automaker also said the $35,000 version of the Model 3 would not be affected by the price increases. They will apply to the higher-end Model X and Model S — cars on which Tesla only recently had been dropping prices — as well as for more expensive versions of the Model 3.The company said customers would have a week to place orders at current prices.Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteFaced with slumping sales and increasing financial stresses, Tesla has shifted course several times in the last two months, deciding to keep stores after saying it would close most and cutting prices before raising them again.Now, in the latest course correction, Tesla says it will end online sales of the long-awaited $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan, its lowest-priced offering, and make other changes that will effectively raise the price of the car for many customers.The move comes just over a month after Tesla announced that the $35,000 version was finally coming to market.“The constant shifting of pricing and options is really confusing and frustrating for customers,” Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said Friday. “People buy a car for one price, and a few weeks later it’s selling for a different price.”In a blog post late Thursday, Tesla said customers wanting the $35,000 version of the Model 3 would have to make the purchase by phone or in person at one of its stores.[Read more: One reporter’s quest to see if Tesla’s new policy made things unnecessarily complicated.]The cheapest Model 3s ordered online will now include Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system and a longer battery range, features that increase the price to $39,500. The blog post said Tesla was making the changes to “simplify vehicle choices and to make Autopilot more affordable.” Such a configuration would previously have cost $40,500, it said.A Tesla spokesman said the change would allow the company to produce one version of the Model 3 and use software to limit the battery range and turn off features such as heated seats for customers who wanted the $35,000 model. A longer range and additional features will be switched on in the $39,500 car, known as the Standard Plus model. Previously, Tesla planned to put a smaller battery pack in the basic model and a larger one in the Standard Plus, the spokesman said.Tesla’s announcement also said it would begin leasing the Model 3, but would not offer customers the option to buy the cars after their leases expired, a departure from the typical industry practice and its own policy on other models.Tesla said it aimed to upgrade Model 3s returned after a lease to allow them to drive themselves, with no human at the wheel, and be deployed in a driverless taxi fleet. The company acknowledged that the technology for driverless taxis was still in development and would need to be approved by safety regulators before such a business could begin.The latest moves coincide with a slump in Tesla’s sales, especially in the United States. In the first quarter, the company delivered about 63,000 cars, a 31 percent drop from the fourth quarter. Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, has also said Tesla has experienced delays and difficulties starting up deliveries of the Model 3 in Europe and China, and will report a loss in the first quarter after producing profits in the final two quarters of 2018.Tesla has forecast 2019 deliveries of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, but after the weak showing in the first quarter, it will have to deliver an average of about 100,000 cars in the final three quarters to reach that range. Domestic demand is likely to be tempered further after July 1, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers falls to $1,875 from the current $3,750.“We think TSLA will be hard pressed to hit the guidance” on deliveries, Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note to investors Thursday.New areas of concern have emerged, too. Tesla’s battery partner, Panasonic, said this week that it was “watching the demand situation” and studying whether to go ahead with further investments in the battery plant, known as the Gigafactory, that the two companies operate in Nevada.The statement was a response to a report by the Japanese news organization Nikkei that Panasonic was freezing its investments in the plant. The company recently ousted the executive who had engineered the partnership with Tesla.In its own statement, Tesla said it and Panasonic “continue to invest substantial funds” in the Nevada plant, but were now focusing more on increasing production without adding new equipment.“We are seeing significant gains from upgrading existing lines to increase output,” Tesla said.A prominent skeptic on Wall Street, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who has long bet against Tesla’s shares, cited the report about the Gigafactory, along with the recent sales figures and accounts of quality problems, as evidence that “the wheels are falling off.”The $35,000 version of the Model 3 has long been seen as a potential gateway to the mass market. As recently as January, Mr. Musk estimated that global demand for the Model 3 would reach 700,000 to 800,000 cars a year “in a strong economy.”He originally began extolling the $35,000 model in 2016. On Feb. 28, in announcing that it was finally becoming available, Mr. Musk said Tesla would  close most of its stores and showrooms to cut costs in hopes of producing the low-priced version at a profit, while increasing its emphasis on online sales. Less than two weeks later, the company retreated, saying it would keep many stores and showrooms open.Tesla’s shares finished slightly lower on Friday, and are down 16 percent since their close on Feb. 28.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteTesla has now shown it can make money — it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit on Wednesday, the first time it has done so — but the automaker still faces many challenges as it seeks to keep its growth going.The Model 3 sedan still costs too much to produce. The company has set an ambitious goal of churning out cars from a new factory in China by the end of the year. And it struggles to provide the kind of customer service that buyers of luxury automobiles expect. Tesla also is planning to spend heavily on a new model even as a big bond payment reduces its cash reserves.Still, Elon Musk, the chief executive, says he believes Tesla’s toughest times are behind it.“This is going to be an amazing year for Tesla,” he said on a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. “I’m optimistic about being profitable in the first quarter, and all quarters going forward.”The automaker’s earnings in the final three months of 2018 leave some doubt about whether its profits will continue to grow. It reported $139 million in earnings in the fourth quarter, a substantial drop from the third quarter, despite a nearly 6 percent jump in revenue, to $7.2 billion.The company blamed the introduction of lower-priced Model 3 variants that generate less profit than costlier versions, price cuts on the vehicles it exports to China and fewer sales of emissions credits to other carmakers.Tesla said it had $3.7 billion in cash, an increase of about $700 million from Sept. 30. With that rise, Tesla said it would be able to make a $920 million payment to its bondholders in March, solving one of the most critical questions about the company’s finances.Investors had been concerned about how Tesla would pay off the bonds, fearing the company could be left squeezed for cash. Tesla could have made part of the bond payment in stock if its share price had been above $360, a level it exceeded for part of last year.The shares closed Wednesday at $308.77 but dropped nearly 5 percent in aftermarket trading after the company announced that its chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when.Tesla said its revenue rose nearly 6 percent to $7.2 billion.Mr. Musk predicted the company would deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, up from 245,000 in 2018, driven by higher sales of the Model 3. The company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter. At the same time, it expects to begin sales in Europe and China.The company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter.Some analysts believe increasing sales may prove tough, now that sales of the Model S luxury sedan and Model X S.U.V. are flattening, and the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers has fallen to $3,750 as of Jan. 1. Last year, customers were eligible for credits of $7,500. And soon it will face competition from other luxury car makers.“Tesla’s product lineup is starting to get stale, and now thanks to the elimination of the federal tax credit, buying one has never been more expensive,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds, an auto-information provider. “While there’s still a cool factor to owning a Tesla, it may not be enough to convince buyers to choose one over brand-new models from Audi, Porsche and Jaguar.”Tesla’s most affordable car is a midrange variant of the Model 3 that starts at $44,000 before tax incentives. Adding options can push the price up to $70,000 or more — well outside the range of most mainstream buyers.Tesla originally promised that the Model 3 would start at $35,000, but Mr. Musk has said the automaker would lose money if it sold the car at that price now. Earlier this month, he said the company would cut 3,000 jobs — about 7 percent of its full-time work force — to reduce costs.Tesla is investing heavily to add showrooms, service centers and charging stations, expand into additional markets and develop new models. These include an electric pickup truck, a semi truck and a small sport-utility vehicle, the Model Y, which Tesla has said it will unveil this year.Mr. Musk has repeatedly said Tesla won’t issue more bonds or sell additional stock to finance its ambitious plans, but many analysts are skeptical. The company is already carrying nearly $10 billion in debt. Issuing new bonds would increase its debt load. Selling additional stock could worry investors.At one time, Tesla said it had more than 400,000 reservations for the Model 3, enough to keep sales and production humming through 2019. Some were deposits on the $35,000 version of the Model 3Mr. Musk said Tesla aimed to start production of the Model 3 in China by the end of the year, at a factory that has not yet been built. Producing cars in China will enable Tesla to avoid that country’s import tariffs that hamper its sales now.The company will also have to spend heavily to build more delivery centers in the United States. Last fall, as Model 3 sales rose, many customers experienced delivery delays and confusion at the company’s showrooms. Others complained of waiting weeks or months for repairs because of severe parts shortages. Some have reported quality problems that vary from cracked windows to rear bumpers falling off.On the conference call, Mr. Musk said improving customer service in North America was his top priority this year.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteTesla’s sleek stores embodied its green vision for upending the transportation and energy business: a one-stop shop for electric cars, solar panels and battery storage. Less than three months ago, the company announced 11 new store locations across the country.Now Tesla is in retreat, shuttering most of its stores in a bid to cut costs. The move signaled the broader vulnerabilities of an upstart that for a time was the most highly valued American car company.A spate of price cuts in the United States points to a slowdown in sales, and the company says it is currently making cars for Europe and China only. But plans to bring the company’s mass-market car, the Model 3, to overseas buyers have been hamstrung by logistical challenges.A long-promised $35,000 version of the Model 3 is finally being offered, but the price will test the company’s profitability. Tesla now expects a loss in the first quarter, rattling investors’ faith in the company and its enigmatic founder, Elon Musk. In recent days, its shares have tumbled more than 13 percent.“I think this company is in scary territory,” said Erik Gordon, a management expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The “flip-flop” on retail strategy, he added, “makes it seem like Musk is winging it and the board is letting him wing it.”Asked for comment on the company’s strategy and outlook, a Tesla spokesman referred to its financial filings and recent statements by Mr. Musk expressing confidence in its course.Mr. Musk has promised a revolution in pretty much every business he has entered. His Space X rockets are meant to take passengers to other planets someday, while his Boring Company aims to solve traffic problems with underground tunnels.At Tesla, Mr. Musk wanted to transform car manufacturing with a highly automated production process. But the company has struggled to master the basics.Production lines sputtered when Mr. Musk pushed to churn out a few thousand cars a week — something established automakers do in a day. Tesla sent customers $70,000 cars with dings, scratches and malfunctioning screens. Some owners needing repairs were told to wait weeks or months for an appointment.Recently, the financial stress on the company has become more evident. It laid off 7 percent of its work force in January, the second job cut in the last eight months. And the company had to use up a quarter of its available cash last week to make a $920 million payment to bondholders, giving it less of a cushion to expand or absorb losses.Next week, Mr. Musk intends to unveil Tesla’s newest offering, the Model Y, a small sport utility vehicle that uses some of the same parts as the Model 3. But those ambitions will further strain Tesla’s capital and could pose a risk to sales of other models.And the abrupt change to online-only sales is a rare strategic reversal.In the final three months of 2018, Tesla opened 27 sales and service locations to keep up with rising demand for the Model 3. Over all, it had more than 100 stores and showrooms nationwide and others overseas. In a Feb. 19 regulatory filing, Tesla said company-owned stores strengthened its brand and helped reach potential customers in major markets.Just nine days later, Mr. Musk said Tesla was going to close all but “a small number” of its stores, which take orders, and galleries, which increase exposure. He also said that the company would no longer offer test drives, and that all sales had to be completed by computer or smartphone.At a darkened Tesla outlet in the Dallas Galleria, one of the locations that opened in December, a security guard sat inside the store this week as passers-by snapped photos of the three cars visible though the glass. A sign proclaimed, “All Tesla Sales Now Online.”As Mr. Musk lays it out, the change is not so radical. In an email to employees, he said that 78 percent of Model 3 orders were already placed online, and that 82 percent of the model’s buyers made their purchase without a test drive.Mr. Musk has made two arguments. He said store closings and related job reductions would enable Tesla to lower costs enough to make money selling Model 3s for $35,000. Financial analysts are not so sure. In a note to his clients, Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company estimated that the profit margin on the base Model 3 was “close to 0 today.”Mr. Musk also said the move to online-only sales would become a strategic advantage. But Mr. Gordon, the University of Michigan professor, questioned whether Tesla would be able to maintain growth without brick-and-mortar stores.“They are not going to grow faster by being online only than by online plus stores,” he said. “It’s a logical impossibility.”In the last three years, Tesla has missed several of the ambitious goals Mr. Musk has set. He once forecast that Tesla would turn out 500,000 cars in 2018, twice what it ultimately produced.Mr. Musk announced last week that Tesla was accepting orders for a Model 3 priced at $35,000 — $8,000 less than the current basic model. But the federal tax credit on Tesla cars has been scaled back, so none of the cars will be available for a total of less than $30,000, as he once heralded.Tesla has reduced prices on its other cars several times in the last two months, including cuts of up to 30 percent on its priciest models last week, suggesting sluggish sales. The online publication InsideEVs, which follows Tesla closely, estimated that the company sold fewer than 8,000 cars in January, down from nearly 30,000 a month at the end of 2018.Asked about sales trends, a Tesla spokesman pointed to a statement by Mr. Musk in his conference call about first-quarter earnings: “The demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability. It’s just that people literally don’t have the money to buy the car.”Like its car sales, Tesla’s residential solar business has hit turbulence, a problem that may be compounded by the store closings. Tesla had positioned its stores as a retail hub for the renewable-energy age, offering electric cars, solar panels and battery storage for both car and home.“Similar to our approach to selling vehicles, we are also shifting sales of our energy and solar products worldwide to online only,” Tesla said in a statement. It said the model would allow customers to save thousands of dollars.But Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the move was likely to be counterproductive. “Online historically is not a very popular way to sell solar,” she said. “It really has not been proven.”SolarCity, the predecessor to Tesla’s solar business, once controlled two-thirds of the residential market. By the end of last year under Tesla’s control, that share was under 10 percent. The latest move, Ms. Mond said, “just adds to the story that, I think, Tesla does not care about their residential solar business.”Many Tesla customers say they have purchased cars online with no problems. For trade-ins, they were able to upload photos and get a quote back without going to a showroom for appraisal. But many still balk at buying an automobile — the second most expensive consumer purchase after a home — without seeing it first.Kevin Smith-Fagan, a television executive in Sacramento, said he did a lot of research online before buying a car, but still preferred to see it up close before making a decision.“There are intangibles that you can only know by getting into the car,” he said. “There’s a comfort level in knowing exactly what you’re getting.”Online or otherwise, Mr. Smith-Fagan is unlikely to be a buyer. He drives another electric car, the Nissan Leaf, that he bought used for $9,000. He would love to own a Tesla, he said, “but for 35 grand, it’s not in the cards.”Ivan Penn and Marina Trahan Martinez contributed reporting.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Tiffany HsuTesla will reduce its full-time work force by 7 percent in an effort to lower the cost of producing its Model 3 sedan and make it a mass-market vehicle, Elon Musk, the electric-car maker’s chief executive, told employees on Friday.The least-expensive version of the Model 3 now available costs $44,000. Mr. Musk said in a companywide email that he wanted the lowest-priced Model 3 to sell for $35,000.To do so, Mr. Musk said in the email, Tesla must improve the car’s design, increase production and shed thousands of workers. “There isn’t any other way,” he wrote.Tesla shares closed down 13 percent after the announcement.The cuts, which could put more than 3,000 people out of work, follow a 9 percent reduction in Tesla’s staff in June. Another of Mr. Musk’s companies, the privately held rocket maker SpaceX, said this month that it would shrink its work force by about 10 percent.Given the continuing uncertainty in global financial markets and signs that consumers are spending less, trimming costs to focus on affordability is “a prudent thing to do” for a company that started out selling cars with an average price close to $100,000, said Romit Shah, a research analyst at Nomura Instinet.In October, Tesla reported that the third quarter of 2018 had yielded its first quarterly profit in two years, and its largest ever, thanks to cost-cutting moves, delayed payments to suppliers and a surge in production and sales.Mr. Musk said in his email on Friday that, based on preliminary, unaudited results, the company expected to earn a smaller profit in the fourth quarter.“This quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,” he wrote in his email on Friday.In the third quarter, Mr. Shah said, Tesla “needed to get to profitability to survive, and they wouldn’t have gotten there if they were selling a $35,000 car.”“They would have lost money on every car they sold,” he added, echoing a sentiment expressed by Mr. Musk last spring.To meet its production and profit targets, Tesla focused on selling more upscale models of the Model 3 to a core group of Tesla enthusiasts willing to pay the higher prices.“But there’s only a finite number of potential customers willing spend over $50,000 on a Model 3,” Mr. Shah said. “If Tesla wants to see a pathway to a million cars sold a year, they’re going to have to bring down that price point.”To succeed, the company will need to extend its appeal to a wider audience. Mr. Musk said Friday that Tesla must begin to deliver its midrange Model 3 in all markets by around May while making progress toward producing the $35,000 version he envisions.“Head count reduction is part of the process,” Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.Tesla has already lowered prices for all of its vehicles this month by $2,000 as a federal tax credit for buyers of electric cars that was worth $7,500 last year begins to be phased out.“While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,” Mr. Musk wrote. Last year “was the most challenging in Tesla’s history,” he added, and “the road ahead is very difficult.”Mr. Musk traveled to Shanghai this month to break ground for Tesla’s Gigafactory assembly plant. It is expected to be producing Model 3s by the end of the year.Having a base in China, which imposes a 15 percent tariff on imported cars, will give Tesla an advantage over automakers that produce vehicles outside the country. But economic activity is slowing in China, and many consumers there are cutting back on spending.The car market in the United States is also showing signs of strain, with sales flattening last year.Tesla is also contending with a challenge from traditional automakers like Ford, General Motors and Nissan, which are pushing harder into the electric-vehicle market. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and others have also introduced or plan to produce electric models that in many cases are less expensive than Tesla’s.As Tesla struggled last year to cope with a Model 3 production and delivery process that Mr. Musk has described as “hell,” his behavior created distractions for the company.In August, he wrote in a short, cryptic post on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private and had “funding secured,” surprising board members and driving up the stock price.The Securities and Exchange Commission later sued Mr. Musk in federal court, saying he had misled investors. He settled with the agency, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and to step aside as chairman for three years.Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byNow that shopping for the cheapest Model 3 can’t be done online, a reporter set out to find just how difficult the process was.By Zach WichterWhen Tesla said on Thursday night that the most basic, $35,000 version of its Model 3 would no longer be offered online, my colleagues and I were confused. Isn’t a Silicon Valley company supposed to be all about the internet? Why do I need to use a phone or, worse, go to one of Tesla’s showrooms and interact with a sales representative in real life to order a high-tech car? I wanted to try the process for myself to see if Tesla’s new policy made things unnecessarily complicated.Though I stopped short of placing an order, it turned out to be quite easy to walk through the purchase process for a Model 3, both online and over the phone. Despite some conflicting information, my phone conversations with people at three Tesla stores in the New York area about buying a Model 3 were efficient and matter-of-fact. Online, it took me less than two minutes to select a car and reach the credit card information page. But you can’t necessarily get the version you’re after, even from a store. And I did learn a few things any potential Tesla buyer should know. Now that Tesla isn’t selling the bare-bones Model 3 online, the least expensive car you can buy on its website goes for $39,500. But Tesla lists the car’s price as $28,950. That figure is later described as “after savings,” and the company even displays the per-month cost of a lease in those terms. As it turns out, Tesla is using some creative math to get to that number. Savings include a $3,750 tax credit currently available to Tesla buyers, but they also include money that you would otherwise spend on gas if you bought a standard car.Using a tool on the Tesla site, you can adjust that figure by changing the number of miles per month you might drive or the cost of gasoline. The company explains what it’s doing, but this still struck me as a questionable sales tactic, especially since the price “after savings” is the first price you see on the website.For buyers looking for the $35,000 base model of the Model 3, the only way to get one without trekking to a store is to make a phone call. When it announced the sales change, Tesla said the “standard” Model 3 was actually a software-limited version of the more expensive car you can buy online. That means the range of the car on a full charge is restricted, for example, not by battery physics but by software that aims to keep it that way.A Tesla sales representative on Long Island explained this, too, and said a buyer could pay the difference for a more capable version at a later date and the car would be updated over the airwaves. For me, the biggest point of confusion had to do with test drives. Tesla says on its website that you can drive a car for a week, or less than 1,000 miles, and still return it. A sales representative in Westchester County repeated this. He also said that if I did a test drive before buying I’d have only one day to return the car, so I reasoned it was probably better to buy first, drive later. What I was told, however, conflicted with the policy as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, recently stated it on Twitter: that returns were possible within one week regardless of a test drive.A Tesla spokeswoman said this was a recent change. Word may not have reached all the stores. Another point on which the stores seem out of step with the company’s party line is in estimating the time it would take to get a car. According to the website, a car should be available in two weeks, but the Westchester store said it might take up to four, especially if I really wanted a less-expensive version of the Model 3. The store in Manhattan said I couldn’t get a $35,000 Model 3 there at all. The cheapest version it had available would cost $45,500.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteFor weeks, analysts have speculated that Tesla has seen a marked drop in sales since the beginning of the year, and the electric-car maker’s recent gyrations on price cuts and cost-saving initiatives have only bolstered their suspicions.Recently compiled data on new-car registrations from a large portion of the United States seems to offer further support for that view. According to the Dominion Cross-Sell Report, a compilation drawn from state motor vehicle records, registrations of new Tesla vehicles fell significantly from January to February in the 23 states the report covers. The states include California, which accounts for about half of Tesla’s sales, as well as Texas, Florida and Washington, three other big markets for the carmaker.Last month, 6,252 Teslas were registered with motor vehicle agencies in the 23 states, compared with 23,310 in January and a monthly average of 13,000 to 17,000 in the fourth quarter. The totals tend to reflect a lag because cars are often not registered until the month after purchase.In December, Tesla was scrambling to sell cars before the end of the year because the federal tax credit available to its customers was set to fall by half on Jan. 1, to $3,850. So a surge in January registrations would not be unexpected. The question is whether an ensuing downturn like the one reflected in the Dominion data would prove lasting.The data for California was even starker, with registrations falling to 2,198 in February from 15,429 in January.A Tesla spokesman said a single month of vehicle registrations did not necessarily reflect the company’s delivery totals. He said registrations in individual states can fluctuate significantly from month to month because the automaker delivers batches of cars to different areas at different times.But as a place holder for Tesla’s official sales figures, such data is already having an impact. Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Company, issued a research note on Friday saying the firm was lowering its Tesla price target to $180, from $200, “to reflect both state-government and third-party data that suggests deliveries during the quarter will be weaker than our prior expectations even with the typical end-of-quarter frantic push.”Tesla shares fell 3.5 percent on Friday, to $264.53.Analysts believe Tesla’s sales flagged after Jan. 1 because of the reduced tax credit, and because its efforts to accelerate sales in December pulled in customers who probably would have bought cars in the next few months. A slump that follows a sales flurry driven by discounts and incentives is a well-known phenomenon in the auto industry. It is called payback.Dominion’s data does not yet reflect Tesla’s introduction of a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan, its lowest-price offering yet, which is likely to lift sales. Tesla began taking orders for the $35,000 version on Feb. 28, but its website says customers will have to wait six to eight weeks for delivery. The company attributed the wait to a wave of orders for the entry-level Model 3.Still, falling registration totals are another worrisome sign for the company. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the automaker would report a loss for the first quarter and expected to take charges against earnings to reflect difficulties in ramping up sales in Europe and China and other challenges.Mr. Osborne, the Cowen analyst, said Tesla’s sales were being watched for clues to its cash position in the next few months. The company had $3.7 billion at the beginning of the year, but used $920 million to make a required payment to bondholders and may drain more cash if it suffers a substantial loss in the first quarter.Mr. Osborne said there were also questions about Tesla’s longer-term growth. “The question is, what is the naturalized rate of demand?” he said.Tesla is expected to report production and delivery totals for the first quarter in early April, followed by its earnings later in the month.Registration data and Tesla’s own sales totals have diverged in the past. In 2018, Tesla said, it delivered 245,000 cars, mostly in the United States. The research firm IHS Markit, which tracks state motor-vehicle data, counted registrations of 164,000 new Teslas nationwide.IHS Markit has not completed a registration count through February. Its nationwide data shows Tesla registrations ranging from 20,000 to 26,000 per month between October and January.Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, a market researcher, said Tesla was likely to have a tougher time increasing sales after an initial rush of orders last year, the first full year of Model 3 sales.“Tesla is going to be challenged now to sell to people outside of their fan base,” she said. “They’re going to have to sell more outside of California. They’ll have to sell to more women. They’re going to have to work harder to find customers.”Tesla is also scrambling to streamline its delivery and sales operations. While warning last month of the first-quarter loss, Mr. Musk said Tesla would close all but “a small number” of its stores worldwide and rely on online sales. He said the cost savings were required to make money on the $35,000 Model 3.Less than two weeks later, Tesla reversed course and said it would keep many showrooms and reopen some that it had closed. It also said it was increasing prices by 3 percent, effective Monday, just weeks after reducing prices. Citing a flurry of orders, the company didn’t put the price increase into effect until Wednesday.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byThe most powerful rocket now available on Earth will wait another day for its next journey to orbit and back.By Kenneth ChangThe flight of the Falcon Heavy will have to wait another day.SpaceX announced that the giant rocket, the most powerful in operation on Earth today, could not fly on Wednesday night because of winds high in the atmosphere.Standing down from today’s Falcon Heavy launch attempt; next opportunity is tomorrow, April 11.The private spaceflight company has a backup opportunity on Thursday evening.The delay pushed back a repeat of the rocket’s majestic lift from the launchpad last February. During that test launch, the Falcon Heavy lofted a spacesuit-wearing mannequin, nicknamed Starman, into a long orbit around the sun. It sat in the driver’s seat of a red Tesla Roadster that belonged to Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX. Video broadcast from orbit turned into the longest car commercial ever.The spacecraft’s payload this time is mundane and useful: Arabsat-6A, a Saudi Arabian communications satellite which will relay television, internet and mobile phone signals to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]The company’s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket, which first launched in 2010. The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together. The second stages of the two rockets are identical. The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift.On the test flight, the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights. (SpaceX’s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching it again; traditionally, rockets have been one-use throwaways, with the booster stages dropped into the ocean.)For this one, the side boosters have never before been used. They are the latest version of the rocket, called “Block Five.” (“Block” is what rocket companies call a major upgrade.) That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry.Yes. The two side boosters are to return to landing pads at Cape Canaveral, not far from the launchpad, just as in the maiden flight.The center booster, which will go higher and farther, is to set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean. That did not quite work as designed on the first try. The booster missed the platform, hitting the water at more than 300 miles per hour. Mr. Musk said the booster did not have enough ignition fuel to light the engines for the final burn.Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless, SpaceX probably made adjustments. That, after all, is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design.SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly. It launched 20 Falcon 9 missions in 2018, more than in any previous year, in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch. The company was also busy at work developing its Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned. When Mr. Musk first announced the rocket in 2011, he said he expected that there would be a 50/50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In the years since, improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful, and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites.The Falcon Heavy is now needed for only the largest satellites like the 13,000-pound Arabsat-6A satellite, which is headed to geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles above Earth.SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the second time on Thursday.One more Falcon Heavy flight is scheduled for this year — a mission for the United States Air Force carrying 25 small satellites.In addition, SpaceX has announced contracts for two Falcon Heavy launches of commercial satellites, and the company has won two competitions to use the rocket for national security missions.At present, no, but that answer could change.In 2017, SpaceX announced that two space tourists would go on an around-the-moon trip in one of the company’s Crew Dragon capsules launched by a Falcon Heavy. But when the first Heavy reached the launchpad last year, SpaceX said it had decided not to go to the expense and effort of making the rocket safe enough for launching people.The possibility of using the Falcon Heavy for lunar missions was revived last month by Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, when he told a Senate committee that the big rocket that his agency is developing, the Space Launch System, would not be ready for its first test flight in 2020. NASA was looking into using commercial rockets as an alternative, he said.One of the alternatives was putting the second stage of the Space Launch System on top of a Falcon Heavy first stage. Mr. Bridenstine later said that option was feasible but could not be done by next year, because major changes would be needed to the boosters and SpaceX’s launchpad to accommodate the Frankenstein rocket combination. Mr. Bridenstine, however, left the door open, saying that NASA would explore all options to meet the Trump administrations goal of sending astronauts back to the moon by the end of 2024.SpaceX’s next-generation rocket was once known as B.F.R. where “B” stood for “big” and “R” stood for “rocket.” It now has the less colorful name Starship. SpaceX has begun small hop tests of a preliminary design, nicknamed Starhopper. The full-fledged design is to reach orbit and eventually make distant journeys to the moon and Mars, but that is still years away.One of Starship’s first passengers is to be Yusaku Maezawa, founder of the online Japanese clothing company Zozo. Mr. Maezawa had been one of the lunar tourists who had signed up for the Falcon Heavy trip around the moon but now will wait longer for the even larger rocket.Kenneth Chang has been at The Times since 2000, writing about physics, geology, chemistry, and the planets. Before becoming a science writer, he was a graduate student whose research involved the control of chaos.  @kchangnyt Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)Elon Musk long promised that Tesla would offer a low-cost Model 3 electric car. Yesterday, he finally made good on that promise — but Tesla is making big sacrifices to offer the vehicle.What $35,000 gets you is a Model 3 that can cover 220 miles before needing a charge, along with a cheaper interior than higher-priced versions. The new Model 3 is expected to start shipping in two to four weeks.Tesla expects to sell a lot of them. The announcement led Mr. Musk to raise production estimates to 600,000 cars in 2019.But it will probably post a loss this quarter. Mr. Musk wouldn’t reveal what kind of margins the company would make on its lowest-priced Model 3. But he admitted, “Given that a lot is happening in Q1, we do not expect to be profitable in the first quarter.”And the company will change its business model. Tesla will only take orders online, close some of its showrooms and lay off employees to save money. “There’s no other way for us to achieve the savings for this car,” Mr. Musk said.Shareholders are worried. Tesla’s stock fell 3 percent in after-hours trading. Liam Denning of Bloomberg Opinion argues that’s “because this crowning moment came with more than a hint of a gamble.”More: Mr. Musk hired a new law firm to defend him against the S.E.C.’s attempt to hold him in contempt of court.President Trump and his top economic advisers have sent a series of conflicting messages about the status of trade talks with China, Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson of the NYT write.• “We’re heading for a historic deal,” Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on CNBC yesterday. “The outlook for a deal is very positive.”• “We are well on our way to doing something special” with China, Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday.• But “I am always prepared to walk. I’m never afraid to walk from a deal,” he added. “I would do that with China, too, if it didn’t work out.”• And “much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more important, after it is reached, if one is reached,” Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, told House lawmakers on Wednesday.A final deal is being prepared according to Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources. Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign it within weeks.But it may not go far enough. “We don’t look at all close to meaningful, enforced provisions on intellectual property,” Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told the NYT.And Mr. Trump has proved he will walk. After he abandoned peace talks with Kim Jong-un of North Korea yesterday, concerns that the president might settle for a poor deal now appear diminished. If he doesn’t like the terms of a China deal, the trade war could continue.More: The U.S. plans to take a hard line in negotiations with Britain over post-Brexit trade.Some of the world’s biggest internet messaging companies hope to succeed where cryptocurrency start-ups have failed by introducing consumers to the world of digital coins, Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaac of the NYT report.“The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.”“The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.”Other platforms are working on similar initiatives. “Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates, has its own coin in the works. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line.”“The new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries,” Mr. Popper and Mr. Isaac write. “But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream.”The American economy slowed at the end of 2018. But there may be worse to come.Gross domestic product growth slowed at the end of last year. It grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2018, Ben Casselman of the NYT reports, compared to a rate of over 4 percent in the middle of the year.“This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace,” Mr. Casselman writes. “Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January.”But the final quarter slowdown wasn’t as severe as many economists had expected. “Even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession,” Mr. Casselman writes, adding, “Most economists do not expect a recession this year.”And the Fed remains optimistic. “The economy is in a good place,” Jay Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said yesterday.Richard Plepler helped make “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones,” two iconic HBO series. But he now plans to step down as the company’s chief executive, in a huge shift under the company’s new owner, AT&T.Mr. Plepler chafed at losing autonomy under his new bosses, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. AT&T has been in talks to hire Robert Greenblatt, a longtime TV executive, for a high-level role at Warner Media, which includes HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Mr. Plepler may have had to report to a former rival.He already had issues with AT&T, particularly John Stankey, the head of Warner Media. Last June, the two men taunted each other uncomfortably in public. Mr. Stankey said that Warner Media needed to make money. Mr. Plepler responded, “We do that” — to which his boss said, “Just not enough.”His departure could precede a larger shake up. Unnamed HBO executives told Peter Kafka of Recode that AT&T wants to further integrate HBO with other Warner Media properties. (Think: early seasons of “Game of Thrones” on TBS.)But it’s a gamble. AT&T believes that it can put good managers into any business and succeed, but Mr. Plepler is beloved by HBO talent. Alex Gibney, who directed a documentary on the health technology company Theranos for the network, called the executive’s departure “dismaying.”In his testimony on Capitol Hill this week, Michael Cohen mentioned several Trump associates whom lawmakers should call in for further questioning. Among them, the NYT reports: Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s C.F.O. and a longtime financial adviser to President Trump.• “On Wednesday, Mr. Cohen specifically identified Mr. Weisselberg as helping mastermind a strategy to mask reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for his payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.”• “For decades, he has represented Mr. Trump on paperwork for everything from complex real estate deals to the operations of the antique carousel in Central Park, which the Trump Organization runs.”• “Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign official, wrote in a book that he co-authored, ‘Let Trump Be Trump’ that Mr. Weisselberg ‘knows of every dime that leaves the building.’”• President Trump thinks his longtime finance chief wouldn’t turn on him, but others aren’t so sure. “I am sure Allen does not want to hurt Donald, I am sure there is an affection there,” Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive, told the NYT. “But he’s in a terrible position — and Donald put him there.”We may hear more from Mr. Weisselberg.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteTesla reported a record quarter on Wednesday, and investors responded with a sell-off.The automaker said it delivered 63,150 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, 13 percent more than in the third quarter. But even that gain fell short of some analysts’ expectations.The growth rate was also well off that of the third quarter, when Model 3 sales more than doubled amid a rush of initial orders as Tesla began high-volume production of the car, on which it has staked its future.And even while the fourth quarter brought overall sales of 90,000 for the first time, the company said Wednesday that it was cutting prices of all models by $2,000 per car. It said the move was meant to partly absorb the reduction of a federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers. But it could also signal that Tesla is trying to insulate itself against softer demand now that it has satisfied the early orders for the Model 3, its first mass-market offering.“The debate is where U.S. demand will be after the initial wave” of buyers, said Brian Johnson, an auto analyst at Barclays Capital. “We have been expecting a lull in the first quarter, or maybe even the first half.”Tesla shares ended trading nearly 7 percent lower.The sales figures were a report card on a year in which its chief executive, Elon Musk, said, “We’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell.” For the first six months of 2018, Tesla struggled to work the kinks out of its Model 3 production lines, and at times was unable to make more than a handful per day.Mr. Musk acknowledged the production system relied too much on automated machinery that was ill suited to certain precision tasks and had to be removed and replaced by human workers. The company also set up a third assembly line in a giant tent outside its factory in Fremont, Calif. Finally, in the second half of 2018, its average weekly production rose to more than 4,000 cars a week, although that was still below its target of 5,000.Tesla ran into trouble delivering the thousands of cars that were rolling off its assembly lines, leaving hundreds of new Model 3s parked in inventory lots in California and other states as the company scrambled to match cars with customers and ship them across the country. Mr. Musk said at one point that Tesla was beginning to make its own auto-hauling trailers to speed deliveries, and later asserted that the company had acquired three trucking companies, although Tesla has not released their names or any details of the transactions.Despite the difficulties, deliveries soared in the third quarter, and the company reported a profit of $312 million, easing concerns about its finances. And even with the decline in Tesla’s shares Wednesday, investors still give the company a higher market value than any of Detroit’s established automakers.In the fourth quarter, Tesla rushed to ship as many cars as possible to ensure that customers could take advantage of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric cars that was available to Tesla buyers. Under the rules of the program, the credit begins to phase out two quarters after a manufacturer’s cumulative sales reach 200,000 electric vehicles. Since Tesla crossed that threshold in July, the tax credit available to Tesla buyers fell to $3,750 on Jan. 1. It falls again on July 1, to $1,875, and ends on Jan. 1, 2020.General Motors is also about to see the credit scaled back for its customers. G.M.’s cumulative sales of electrified vehicles rose in December to more than 200,000, according to a person briefed on the matter. As a result, buyers of the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt and hybrid Chevy Volt will qualify for the full tax credit only until March 31.Analysts will be watching closely to see if the halving of the federal tax credit slows the growth rate of Model 3 sales further in the first quarter. They said the fourth-quarter growth rate was modest, given Tesla’s rush to deliver cars before end of the year, and the incentives it offered to entice buyers.The company reported that only 1,010 Model 3s were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter, down from more than 8,000 on Sept. 30. At the same time, deliveries of Tesla’s other two cars — the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle — were flat in the fourth quarter, raising questions about demand for those vehicles.“Sustainability of Model 3 demand is likely to emerge as key investor question,” Toni Sacconaghi, of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to clients.Over all, Tesla delivered 90,700 cars in the fourth quarter, up 9 percent from the third quarter. Production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles, including 61,394 Model 3s. For the full year, Tesla sold 245,240 cars, an increase of about 100,000 from 2017.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteAfter lurching from crisis to crisis last year, Tesla appeared to have found its footing in January when it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit and said it had more than enough cash to pay off bonds coming due in March.The calm did not last.On Wednesday, Tesla said its general counsel was leaving the job after just two months. It was the second unexpected departure of a high-level Tesla executive in less than a month and one of dozens in the last three years.The general counsel, Dane Butswinkas, was a prominent Washington trial lawyer who represented the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, when he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year over claims that he had secured funding to take the company private. Tesla said Mr. Butswinkas had decided to return to his law firm and would be replaced by Jonathan Chang, a vice president in its legal department.Three weeks earlier, on Jan. 30, Mr. Musk surprised analysts on a conference call by announcing that Tesla’s chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when. Last year, Tesla’s chief accounting officer, David Morton, stepped down after just a month on the job. Mr. Morton’s predecessor, Eric Branderiz, left after 14 months. All told, Tesla has lost more than 40 senior executives since the beginning of 2016, according to a list compiled by Reuters.Mr. Butswinkas’s departure was all the more noteworthy because it came less than 24 hours after Mr. Musk made an ambitious prediction on Twitter about the company’s production goals, an action that raised questions about his compliance with the settlement that he and Tesla reached with the S.E.C.Mr. Musk said that he expected the company to produce 500,000 cars this year — 100,000 more than he had forecast just three weeks earlier. Four hours later, Mr. Musk said he had misspoken.In the settlement with the S.E.C., he and Tesla had agreed that it would put in place “mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk’s Tesla-related written communications” that might have material information. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on what scrutiny had been given to Mr. Musk’s incorrect Tuesday statement before it was posted.The S.E.C.’s securities fraud case stemmed from a Twitter post in August in which Mr. Musk said he planned to take the company private at $420 a share and had “funding secured.” In addition to the condition about reviewing his statements, Mr. Musk agreed to step down as chairman; he and the company each paid penalties of $20 million; and the company added two new independent directors.“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the general counsel is leaving after a tweet that appears to violate the agreement,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive editor of RebeccaDrives.com, an auto-industry and car review website. “It calls into question the oversight of the board and the adherence to the S.E.C. settlement.”The S.E.C. and the Justice Department have been looking into whether Mr. Musk misled investors about its production goals. Mr. Musk had once predicted that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2018. The company actually made about 245,000 cars last year.Tesla said in a securities filing on Tuesday that it “will continue to cooperate with government authorities.”The stream of executive departures is one of several challenges for Tesla. It is scrambling to secure financing to build a plant in China, one that Mr. Musk has vowed would begin churning out cars by the end of this year. Sales of its two most profitable models, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle, are flat. And it is still unable to produce a $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan, which many customers are holding out for.Next month, Tesla has to pay bondholders $920 million, which would consume about a quarter of the $3.7 billion it had in cash at the end of December.The company’s stock closed down 1 percent on Wednesday.Tesla’s sales appear to have dropped off markedly since the beginning of the year, when a federal tax credit available to Tesla customers was cut in half, to $3,750. An online publication that follows Tesla closely, InsideEVs, has estimated that the company sold 6,500 cars in January, a 75 percent drop from the final months of 2018, when buyers could still take advantage of the full tax credit.Tesla has declined to comment on the estimate, but customer traffic appears to have dropped off significantly at its showrooms. On Saturday afternoon, a saleswoman at a company store in Warrendale, Pa., near Pittsburgh, showed a customer a Model 3 while six other employees stood idly by. While more than 50 Teslas were parked in the back, just two cars were parked in spots reserved for prospective buyers.In addition, as production and sales have increased, so have complaints about quality and customer service. Many customers have had to wait months to have their cars repaired because of shortages of replacement parts.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byI saw the greatest minds of my generation log 18-hour days — and then boast about #hustle on Instagram. When did performative workaholism become a lifestyle?By Erin GriffithNever once at the start of my workweek — not in my morning coffee shop line; not in my crowded subway commute; not as I begin my bottomless inbox slog — have I paused, looked to the heavens and whispered: #ThankGodIt’sMonday. Apparently, that makes me a traitor to my generation. I learned this during a series of recent visits to WeWork locations in New York, where the throw pillows implore busy tenants to “Do what you love.” Neon signs demand they “Hustle harder,” and murals spread the gospel of T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork’s water coolers have an agenda. “Don’t stop when you’re tired,” someone recently carved into the floating vegetables’ flesh. “Stop when you are done.” Kool-Aid drinking metaphors are rarely this literal.Welcome to hustle culture. It is obsessed with striving, relentlessly positive, devoid of humor, and — once you notice it — impossible to escape. “Rise and Grind” is both the theme of a Nike ad campaign and the title of a book by a “Shark Tank” shark. New media upstarts like the Hustle, which produces a popular business newsletter and conference series, and One37pm, a content company created by the patron saint of hustling, Gary Vaynerchuk, glorify ambition not as a means to an end, but as a lifestyle.“The current state of entrepreneurship is bigger than career,” reads the One37pm “About Us” page. “It’s ambition, grit and hustle. It’s a live performance that lights up your creativity … a sweat session that sends your endorphins coursing ... a visionary who expands your way of thinking.” From this point of view, not only does one never stop hustling — one never exits a kind of work rapture, in which the chief purpose of exercising or attending a concert is to get inspiration that leads back to the desk.Ryan Harwood, the chief executive of One37pm’s parent company, told me that the site’s content is aimed at a younger generation of people who are seeking permission to follow their dreams. “They want to know how to own their moment, at any given moment,” he said.“Owning one’s moment” is a clever way to rebrand “surviving the rat race.” In the new work culture, enduring or even merely liking one’s job is not enough. Workers should love what they do, and then promote that love on social media, thus fusing their identities to that of their employers. Why else would LinkedIn build its own version of Snapchat Stories?This is toil glamour, and it is going mainstream. Most visibly, WeWork — which investors recently valued at $47 billion — is on its way to becoming the Starbucks of office culture. It has exported its brand of performative workaholism to 27 countries, with 400,000 tenants, including workers from 30 percent of the Global Fortune 500.In January, WeWork’s founder, Adam Neumann, announced that his start-up was rebranding itself as the We Company, to reflect an expansion into residential real estate and education. Describing the shift, Fast Company wrote: “Rather than just renting desks, the company aims to encompass all aspects of people’s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.” The ideal client, one imagines, is someone so enamored of the WeWork office aesthetic — whip-cracking cucumbers and all — that she sleeps in a WeLive apartment, works out at a Rise by We gym, and sends her children to a WeGrow school.From this vantage, “Office Space,” the Gen-X slacker paean that came out 20 years ago next month, feels like science fiction from a distant realm. It’s almost impossible to imagine a start-up worker bee of today confessing, as protagonist Peter Gibbons does, “It’s not that I’m lazy. It’s that I just don’t care.” Workplace indifference just doesn’t have a socially acceptable hashtag.It’s not difficult to view hustle culture as a swindle. After all, convincing a generation of workers to beaver away is convenient for those at the top.“The vast majority of people beating the drums of hustle-mania are not the people doing the actual work. They’re the managers, financiers and owners,” said David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a software company. We spoke in October, as he was promoting his new book, “It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work,” about creating healthy company cultures.Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said that despite data showing long hours improve neither productivity nor creativity, myths about overwork persist because they justify the extreme wealth created for a small group of elite techies. “It’s grim and exploitative,” he said.Elon Musk, who stands to reap stock compensation upward of $50 billion if his company, Tesla, meets certain performance levels, is a prime example of extolling work by the many that will primarily benefit him. He tweeted in November that there are easier places to work than Tesla, “but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” The correct number of hours “varies per person,” he continued, but is “about 80 sustained, peaking about 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.”Mr. Musk, who has more than 24 million Twitter followers, further noted that if you love what you do, “it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work.” Even he had to soften the lie of T.G.I.M. with a parenthetical.Arguably, the technology industry started this culture of work zeal sometime around the turn of the millennium, when the likes of Google started to feed, massage and even play doctor to its employees. The perks were meant to help companies attract the best talent — and keep employees at their desks longer. It seemed enviable enough: Who wouldn’t want an employer that literally took care of your dirty laundry?But today, as tech culture infiltrates every corner of the business world, its hymns to the virtues of relentless work remind me of nothing so much as Soviet-era propaganda, which promoted impossible-seeming feats of worker productivity to motivate the labor force. One obvious difference, of course, is that those Stakhanovite posters had an anticapitalist bent, criticizing the fat cats profiting from free enterprise. Today’s messages glorify personal profit, even if bosses and investors — not workers — are the ones capturing most of the gains. Wage growth has been essentially stagnant for years.Perhaps we’ve all gotten a little hungry for meaning. Participation in organized religion is falling, especially among American millennials. In San Francisco, where I live, I’ve noticed that the concept of productivity has taken on an almost spiritual dimension. Techies here have internalized the idea — rooted in the Protestant work ethic — that work is not something you do to get what you want; the work itself is all. Therefore any life hack or company perk that optimizes their day, allowing them to fit in even more work, is not just desirable but inherently good.Aidan Harper, who created a European workweek-shrinkage campaign called 4 Day Week, argues that this is dehumanizing and toxic. “It creates the assumption that the only value we have as human beings is our productivity capability — our ability to work, rather than our humanity,” he told me.It’s cultist, Mr. Harper added, to convince workers to buy into their own exploitation with a change-the-world message. “It’s creating the idea that Elon Musk is your high priest,” he said. “You’re going into your church every day and worshiping at the altar of work.”For congregants of the Cathedral of Perpetual Hustle, spending time on anything that’s nonwork related has become a reason to feel guilty. Jonathan Crawford, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur, told me that he sacrificed his relationships and gained more than 40 pounds while working on Storenvy, his e-commerce start-up. If he socialized, it was at a networking event. If he read, it was a business book. He rarely did anything that didn’t have a “direct R.O.I.,” or return on investment, for his company.Mr. Crawford changed his lifestyle after he realized it made him miserable. Now, as an entrepreneur-in-residence at 500 Start-ups, an investment firm, he tells fellow founders to seek out nonwork-related activities like reading fiction, watching movies or playing games. Somehow this comes off as radical advice. “It’s oddly eye-opening to them because they didn’t realize they saw themselves as a resource to be expended,” Mr. Crawford said.It’s easy to become addicted to the pace and stress of work in 2019. Bernie Klinder, a consultant for a large tech company, said he tried to limit himself to five 11-hour days per week, which adds up to an extra day of productivity. “If your peers are competitive, working a ‘normal workweek’ will make you look like a slacker,” he wrote in an email.Still, he’s realistic about his place in the rat race. “I try to keep in mind that if I dropped dead tomorrow, all of my acrylic workplace awards would be in the trash the next day,” he wrote, “and my job would be posted in the paper before my obituary.”The logical endpoint of excessively avid work, of course, is burnout. That is the subject of a recent viral essay by the BuzzFeed cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen, which thoughtfully addresses one of the incongruities of hustle-mania in the young. Namely: If Millennials are supposedly lazy and entitled, how can they also be obsessed with killing it at their jobs?Millennials, Ms. Petersen argues, are just desperately striving to meet their own high expectations. An entire generation was raised to expect that good grades and extracurricular overachievement would reward them with fulfilling jobs that feed their passions. Instead, they wound up with precarious, meaningless work and a mountain of student loan debt. And so posing as a rise-and-grinder, lusty for Monday mornings, starts to make sense as a defense mechanism.Most jobs — even most good jobs! — are full of pointless drudgery. Most corporations let us down in some way. And yet years after the HBO satire “Silicon Valley” made the vacuous mission statement “making the world a better place” a recurring punch line, many companies still cheerlead the virtues of work with high-minded messaging. For example, Spotify, a company that lets you listen to music, says that its mission is “to unlock the potential of human creativity.” Dropbox, which lets you upload files and stuff, says its purpose is “to unleash the world’s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.”David Spencer, a professor of economics at Leeds University Business School, says that such posturing by companies, economists and politicians dates at least to the rise of mercantilism in 16th-century Europe. “There has been an ongoing struggle by employers to venerate work in ways that distract from its unappealing features,” he said. But such propaganda can backfire. In 17th-century England, work was lauded as a cure for vice, Mr. Spencer said, but the unrewarding truth just drove workers to drink more.Internet companies may have miscalculated in encouraging employees to equate their work with their intrinsic value as human beings. After a long era of basking in positive esteem, the tech industry is experiencing a backlash both broad and fierce, on subjects from monopolistic behavior to spreading disinformation and inciting racial violence. And workers are discovering how much power they wield. In November, some 20,000 Googlers participated in a walkout protesting the company’s handling of sexual abusers. Other company employees shut down an artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon that could have helped military drones become more lethal.Mr. Heinemeier Hansson cited the employee protests as evidence that millennial workers would eventually revolt against the culture of overwork. “People aren’t going to stand for this,” he said, using an expletive, “or buy the propaganda that eternal bliss lies at monitoring your own bathroom breaks.” He was referring to an interview that the former chief executive of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, gave in 2016, in which she said that working 130 hours a week was possible “if you’re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.”Ultimately, workers must decide if they admire or reject this level of devotion. Ms. Mayer’s comments were widely panned on social media when the interview ran, but since then, Quora users have eagerly shared their own strategies for mimicking her schedule. Likewise, Mr. Musk’s “pain level” tweets drew plenty of critical takes, but they also garnered just as many accolades and requests for jobs.The grim reality of 2019 is that begging a billionaire for employment via Twitter is not considered embarrassing, but a perfectly plausible way to get ahead. On some level, you have to respect the hustlers who see a dismal system and understand that success in it requires total, shameless buy-in. If we’re doomed to toil away until we die, we may as well pretend to like it. Even on Mondays.Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Tim GrayThree of the first quarter’s top-performing mutual funds won big by favoring small- and midcap growth stocks, toting up quarterly returns of 25 percent or more.The Virtus Zevenbergen Innovative Growth Stock Fund buys shares of companies of all sizes — its largest holding lately has been Amazon — but its big winners, so far this year, have been smaller fare such as WayFair, an online seller of home furnishings, and the Trade Desk, an online advertising marketplace.Nancy A. Zevenbergen, the fund’s lead manager, said her interest in growth stocks dates to the ’80s. She worked then in the trust department of a Seattle bank and followed — and was fascinated by — the 1986 initial public stock sale of a homegrown outfit named Microsoft. (Microsoft is based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Wash.) A year later, she started Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle. Her mutual fund began in 2004.Being on the West Coast has proved an advantage, she said. Not only has Seattle birthed tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, but “Silicon Valley is a day trip for us,” she said.Throughout her career, she has sought stocks she thinks can keep increasing revenue by at least 15 percent a year. Her mantra is: “Revenue growth, revenue growth, revenue growth,” she said.Favorite holdings can stay in the fund for years: Mercadolibre, an Argentine e-commerce outfit, has been there for a decade. That stock was lately one of only 31 in the fund, compared with 157 for the average actively managed United States stock fund tracked by Morningstar.Ms. Zevenbergen says she prefers companies that are run by their founders. As an example, she pointed to Microsoft. The stock soared while one of the founders, Bill Gates, steered the company but languished under his successor, Steven A. Ballmer. What’s more, boards of directors are typically not as patient with outsider C.E.O.s, and long-term investments require patience, she said.Her liking for founder-led outfits is part of the reason her fund has owned Tesla, the electric-car maker led by Elon Musk, since its 2010 initial public stock offering. Despite Tesla’s recent operational problems, she said: “Elon Musk is doing things people said couldn’t be done — and he’s up against an old, established industry and organized labor.”Ms. Zevenbergen added: “You can often get a C.E.O. with an M.B.A. from Harvard, but do they have the passion to run the business that the founder had?”The Virtus Zevenbergen fund, whose A shares have a net expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 25.24 percent in the first quarter, compared with a total return of 13.65 percent for the S&P 500 stock index.Matthew A. Weatherbie, one of the managers of the Alger SMid Cap Focus Fund, has been chasing growth stocks even longer than Ms. Zevenbergen. His investment career began in the ’70s, and he ran Putnam Voyager, then a well-known fund, starting in 1983. He left Putnam to start his own investment company in 1995, and he has managed the Alger fund since 2017. (Alger Associates acquired Mr. Weatherbie’s company in 2017.)Like Ms. Zevenbergen, he said his investment philosophy has remained consistent. “There have been some tweaks over time, but the basic process is the same,” he said. He and his co-managers seek companies in a growth sweet spot, he said. “They’ve been in business long enough to survive the perils of infancy, but they’ve got a long runway of growth ahead of them.”How three of the better performers of the first quarter of 2019 fared against the market — and against their peer groups of funds.Virtus Zevenbergen Innovative+30%+20+10S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.0JFMFIRST-QUARTER RETURNSVirtus Zevenbergen Innovative+25.2%Large-cap growth+16.0%Alger SMid Cap Focus+30%+20+10S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.0JFMFIRST-QUARTER RETURNSAlger SMid Cap Focus+30.6%Mid-cap growth+19.1%Lord Abbett Developing Growth+30%+20+10S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.0JFMFIRST-QUARTER RETURNSLord Abbett Developing Growth+27.1%Small-cap growth+18.1%Virtus Zevenbergen InnovativeAlger SMid Cap FocusLord Abbett Developing Growth+30%+30%+30%+20+20+20+10+10+10S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.S. & P. 500 TOTAL RET.000JFMJFMJFMFIRST-QUARTER RETURNSVirtus Zevenbergen InnovativeAlger SMid Cap FocusLord Abbett Developing Growth+25.2%+30.6%+27.1%Large-cap growthMid-cap growthSmall-cap growth+16.0%+19.1%+18.1%By The New York Times | Source: Morningstar DirectHoldings also must have “a competitive moat around the business, a strong balance sheet, high inherent profitability and a high-quality management team,” he said.To assemble the portfolio, the fund’s managers and analysts collaborate to identify 50 holdings that meet these criteria. Mr. Weatherbie and his co-portfolio managers — H. George Dai and Joshua D. Bennett — next take an unusual step.They divide the portfolio into three baskets. The managers then independently evaluate the 50 stocks, each determining the portion of the fund’s assets dedicated to each stock in his basket. As a result, the fund’s largest stakes are the stocks most favored by all three.“Why is Chegg or FirstService a top five holding?” Mr. Weatherbie asked. “Because each of us has determined that those are high-conviction names.”Chegg is an education-services company, while FirstService is a property manager and service provider for condos and cooperatives.Mr. Bennett said both companies exemplify something the managers hunt for: They’re fast growers in “mundane markets” not associated with zippy stocks in the way, say, consumer electronics and online entertainment are. Mr. Weatherbie added: “Our process enables us to identify hidden gems in mundane industries.”The Alger fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.33 percent, returned 30.58 percent in the first quarter.F. Thomas O’Halloran, the lead manager of the Lord Abbett Developing Growth Fund, seeks companies that show both disruption and momentum. For example, he has won lately with such well-known names as Yeti Holdings, the maker of insulated cups and coolers, and Roku, the video streaming outfit.These companies are disrupting their industries, he says, and their shares have lately trended upward.Take Roku and its streaming devices, which compete with ones sold by such tech behemoths as Apple and Amazon. “It’s not that one form of streaming is better than another,” Mr. O’Halloran said. “It’s that streaming is better than cable and regular TV, and Roku is the only Swiss-neutral platform.” Other devices are interwoven with technologies or business models peddled by their sellers.Mr. O’Halloran said he often finds promising picks among consumer stocks for the simple reason that consumer purchases drive growth in the United States. “That’s where 70 percent of spending in U.S. economy is,” he said.When considering what to wager on, Mr. O’Halloran said, he prefers companies with hefty potential markets — like Yeti. “The whole planet likes its food and beverages at the right temperature,” he said.He differs from some portfolio managers in that he bars members of his analyst team from writing reports on the companies they follow, relying instead on quick emails and frequent meetings. Churning out reports can lead to delays and self-defeating behavior, he said. “By the time you get a report done, a quarter to half of the stock move may be over. And when the stock peaks, you don’t want to let it go, because you wrote the big report on it.”Mr. O’Halloran’s fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 0.93 percent, returned 27.13 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — Lawyers for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and U.S. securities regulators are getting another week to negotiate a deal to keep Musk from being found in contempt of court.Both sides say in a letter filed Thursday with a federal court in New York that they talked for over an hour this week and are continuing to discuss an agreement. District Judge Alison Nathan granted the request to talk until April 25.Lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the court to find Musk in contempt for violating a settlement order that requires Musk's tweets to be approved by a lawyer if they disclose important company facts.Nathan had ordered both sides to meet and work out differences by Thursday.The settlement was reached last year after Musk tweeted he had secured funding to take Tesla private even though he had not. The SEC says Musk violated that agreement when he tweeted about vehicle production without approval in February.Nathan had ordered both sides to meet for at least an hour to work out their differences and if they couldn't, she would rule on whether to hold Musk in contempt.The settlement was reached last October after Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private when in fact he had not. The tweet sent Tesla's stock on a wild ride and the SEC says it harmed investors who bought shares after the tweet but before they had accurate information.The SEC says Musk violated the agreement when he tweeted about vehicle production in February without approval.The 13-word tweet said Tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year. But it wasn't approved by Tesla's ""disclosure counsel,"" and the SEC said Musk had not sought a lawyer's approval for a single tweet.Musk argued the tweet didn't need approval because it wasn't new information that was meaningful to investors. His attorneys said the SEC was violating his First Amendment right to free speech.Musk tweeted about vehicle production again on Sunday, writing that Tesla will make 500,000 cars in the next 12 months. The SEC did not respond to requests for comment on that tweet.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteA potential rival to Tesla in electric cars just got a big boost from Amazon.The online retail giant is leading a $700 million investment in Rivian, a Michigan company that is developing a battery-powered pickup truck and an electric sport utility vehicle. The automaker announced the new round of investment on Friday, offering few details but saying it would remain independent.Founded in 2009 by an M.I.T.-trained engineer, R. J. Scaringe, Rivian first showed its truck and S.U.V. at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. The key feature of each is a chassis that is shaped like a skateboard and includes all the components that propel the vehicles — a large battery pack, axles, suspension, cooling system and four electric motors. The company says its pickup will be able to go up to 400 miles on a full charge.The deal is the latest example of how the auto industry is being reshaped by new technologies and nimble companies that have raced ahead of many traditional carmakers. While General Motors, Ford Motor and others are scrambling to introduce new electric vehicles, Tesla has become by far the leading seller of electric cars in the United States. Waymo, a division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is considered by some analysts to be the leading developer of autonomous vehicles.“We’re inspired by Rivian’s vision for the future of electric transportation,” Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s chief executive for worldwide consumer, said in a statement. “R. J. has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. We’re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.”An Amazon spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the thinking behind the Rivian investment.Since 2015, Amazon has been building out its own logistics network, one that is a “global, end-to-end network covering all transportation modalities,” Morgan Stanley said in a research note last month. It owns dozens of planes and has a transoceanic shipping operation, not to mention trucks, rail and other ways to deliver products and packages. The company spent more than $27 billion on worldwide shipping last year.Amazon relies on contract drivers in passenger cars and trucks to make many last-minute deliveries quicker than it can through delivery partners like the United States Postal Service. Last month, the company said it was testing a delivery device called Scout, which is the size of a large ice chest that can “roll along sidewalks at a walking pace.” The company says it is using the devices to deliver packages to customers in a suburb near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.The company ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans last year for its delivery partners to shuttle Amazon products to consumers, but those vans run on diesel, a fossil fuel. The company has also been facing pressure from employees looking to reduce its environmental impact, particularly in its logistics operations.And last week, Amazon made a “significant” investment in Aurora, a California start-up that is developing self-driving technology. Aurora is led by Chris Urmson, who previously headed Alphabet’s autonomous car effort.“For Amazon, this small investment is a good way to enlarge their bet on the E.V. automotive market without having to tool up a plant to find out if it will fly,” said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor of Kelley Blue Book. “Over time, the Rivian investment could give Amazon a starting point to own and operate an in-house package delivery business.”Rivian previously raised about $500 million from Sumitomo, a Japanese conglomerate known for its tire division, and Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi industrial group. Those earlier investors also took part in the new investment round, though the companies did not say how much money they put in.At the Los Angeles show, Mr. Scaringe described the company's pickup, the R1T, and its S.U.V., the R1S, as upscale vehicles that could be used for off-road adventures. They are intended to compete for motorists who buy pricey Land Rovers and Porsche S.U.V.s. Rivian’s vehicles are expected to sell for $68,000 or more.“This is a vehicle you can use,” Mr. Scaringe said. “You can get it dirty, but it’s still a very thoughtful, intelligent design.”Both vehicles may end up competing directly with Tesla models. Tesla already offers an S.U.V., the Model X, and is working on a pickup truck and a smaller S.U.V. Rivian has said it aims to sell about 20,000 vehicles in 2021 and double that in 2022. Last year, Tesla sold about 245,000 cars.Analysts said Rivian’s success was by no means assured.“They still face all the hurdles,” said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. “They have to produce the vehicles. They have to deliver the vehicles. Tesla has been around longer, but it’s still struggling to set up a dealer network and is struggling with high-volume production.”Rivian has kept a low profile, especially compared with Tesla and its flamboyant chief executive, Elon Musk. Until recently, to keep its operations secret, Rivian did not display its name on its buildings. While Mr. Scaringe has a Twitter account, he has posted only 87 tweets — a small fraction of Mr. Musk’s nearly 7,000.And while Tesla and Mr. Musk regularly make headlines, relatively little is known about Mr. Scaringe, who is 36. He grew up near Melbourne, Fla.; studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He then created a company, Mainstream Motors, in Florida, intending to produce an affordable sports car that could go 60 miles on a gallon of gas. In 2011, the company was renamed Rivian, and its focus shifted to electric vehicles.Rivian employs 600 people, with its main office in Plymouth, Mich., about 30 miles west of Detroit. In 2016, it bought a mothballed auto plant in Normal, Ill., previously owned by Mitsubishi Motors.Chris Koos, the mayor of Normal, where Rivian plans to produce its vehicles, described Mr. Scaringe as a “broad thinker” who seems immersed in operational details.“When you ask him a technical question, you can expect about a 10-minute answer,” Mr. Koos said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Amazon’s part in a new investment round in Rivian. The company is leading the $700 million investment, not investing $700 million itself, according to Rivian.Karen Weise contributed reporting.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported bywith interestPlus, The National Enquirer is for sale, and Elon Musk must make nice with the S.E.C.By Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox? Sign up here.You're a busy person, so here's your quick and breezy catch-up on the latest in tech and business news, plus what to know for the week ahead. Your Monday self will be better for it.APRIL 7-13Your ride is (almost) here, but how much is it worth? Uber’s widely anticipated initial public offering, on track for early May, is said to aim for a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion. That’s significantly lower than the $120 billion that many investors had expected, although it would still be the largest I.P.O. since 2014. Why the falling numbers? For one thing, the ride-sharing company lost $1.8 billion last year, and its growth is slowing. Plus, everyone has been taking note of what happened after the recent I.P.O. of Uber’s smaller rival Lyft. Its shares have already dropped roughly 20 percent below their offering price. The National Enquirer, the checkout-line mainstay known for peddling headlines about aliens on the moon and, more recently, aiding President Trump’s 2016 candidacy, is for sale. The tabloid is led by David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s, and there’s word of a surprising potential buyer: the billionaire Ron Burkle, a Democratic donor with ties to former President Bill Clinton. The publication came under scrutiny for helping Mr. Trump’s political rise by buying the rights to a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him and then never publishing it — a tabloid practice known as catch-and-kill. The Enquirer is now under federal investigation for claims that it threatened Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, with “extortion and blackmail” after exposing details about his extramarital affair. Just what no one wanted: Six more months of Brexit drama. European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday to extend Britain’s withdrawal deadline — again — this time to Oct. 31. Now, British lawmakers will have more time to argue over their long-overdue departure plan, which they’ve already had three years to discuss. While they haggle, businesses will continue to plan for the worst until Brexit trade policies are settled, compromising the country’s economic growth. On the upside, Britain did not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a deal, which could have wreaked economic havoc. But is the extension just prolonging the inevitable? APRIL 14-20Thursday is the deadline for Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out their differences on Mr. Musk’s Twitter practices. A federal judge in New York has asked both parties to submit a joint letter with clear guidelines about Mr. Musk’s tweets — namely, when Mr. Musk must get approval from a Tesla lawyer before posting. The S.E.C. sought more oversight of Mr. Musk’s communications after he tweeted erroneous information about Tesla more than once, first about taking the company private and later about its production numbers. (Presumably, he will be allowed to keep tweeting about cheese-related flatulence and multicolored squirrels whenever he pleases, as he recently did.) A jury will get to decide whether Apple owes money to the chip manufacturer Qualcomm, which might sound dull if not for the cast of tech stars involved. Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Steve Mollenkopf, his counterpart at Qualcomm, are both expected to take the stand at the trial, which begins in San Diego this week. Top brass from other technology companies, like the manufacturing giant Foxconn, are also expected to testify. The showdown is a culmination of a two-year global fight between tech giants, with Qualcomm seeking back payment for chips used in iPhones and Apple disputing Qualcomm’s claims to certain technology. More big banks will release their first-quarter earnings this coming week, and the results may be stronger than expected if JPMorgan’s report on Friday was any indication. Analysts had lowered their projections for bank profits in recent months for a mix of reasons, including the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on interest rates. Banks’ performances are often seen as a litmus test for overall economic health, and the latest numbers may offer clues to how much we should be worried about a recession — or whether we’re overly paranoid. Disney unveiled plans to take on Netflix with its own streaming service, which will cost $7 a month when it becomes available on Nov. 12. In other news, J. Crew is considering a spinoff of its smaller, fast-growing brand Madewell to raise some much-needed cash. Speaking of crunches, Boeing still has no timetable for getting its grounded 737 Max jets back in the air, and the costs of fixing the planes — and convincing regulators, airlines and passengers that they’re safe to fly — are starting to pile up.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department on Wednesday issued a draft environmental assessment for a Washington, D.C. to Baltimore tunnel that would carry passengers between the cities at high speeds in autonomous electric vehicles, the first step in a joint federal-state review of the Elon Musk project.Musk's Boring Co has proposed a privately funded 35.3-mile ""loop project"" that would include twin underground tunnels transporting passengers at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour.The company says passengers would be able to travel from downtown Washington to Baltimore in as little as 15 minutes.Musk, who also leads electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, is seeking to revolutionize transportation by digging tunnels, including one that would connect downtown Chicago and the city's main airport.The draft assessment is an ""early milestone in the environmental review and permitting process,"" the Transportation Department said, adding it will be open for public comment for 45 days. Then the Federal Highway Administration and Maryland Department of Transportation will review comments and decide if a formal environmental impact statement is necessary.Final governmental approvals will depend on the outcome of the review and officials noted ""operational safety issues will be addressed in future studies, as will the ultimate engineering and design details.""The tunnel route would largely follow the right-of-way under the Baltimore Washington Parkway and the proposed station terminals would be located on New York Avenue northwest of Washington's Union Station and in the Camden Yards area in downtown Baltimore.The loop project is separate from hyperloop proposals, which involve ultra-high speed, fixed intercity transportation systems in which passengers are transported in pressurized capsules that operate in sealed partial-vacuum tubes at 600 miles per hour or faster, the department said. Boring says the loop tunnels would be compatible with hyperloop requirements and the loop tunnels could eventually be part of the faster system.The Transportation Department said tunnel activity will take place at an average of 30 feet below ground and the draft review addresses noise or vibration impacts at surface level, which according to the proposal are expected to be ""minimal, subject to further design and engineering analysis.""Last year, Chicago selected Boring to build a $1 billion underground transit system to take people from Chicago’s downtown Loop district to O’Hare International Airport.The Chicago project's fate is up in the air and Boring has yet to sign a contract with the city to build the tunnels.Boring did not immediately comment Wednesday but has said the East Coast tunnel ""would serve as the central artery for a potential future transportation network which would hopefully be extended to New York.""Boring says it would take between 12 and 20 months to dig the tunnels and would include up to 70 ventilation shafts/emergency exits on private property adjacent to the alignment.

Both side boosters returned to Cape Canaveral, Florida, while the core booster landed on a platform hundreds of miles offshore.The company confirmed Tuesday that the unsecured core booster toppled onto the platform over the weekend, as waves reached 8 to 10 feet.SpaceX chief Elon Musk says the engines seem OK.

" AdvertisementSupported bywith interestBy Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox? Sign up here.Welcome to your quick and painless summary of tech and business news. You don’t need reminding that it’s the shortest weekend of the year; make the most of it.MARCH 3-9Facebook, the platform known for sharing your personal information with the world whether you like it or not, is going for a more discreet vibe these days. The company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wants to nudge users toward “private” messaging and away from blasting their networks with status updates, a trend he says is already underway. He likened his new vision, which will integrate other Facebook-owned platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, to a “digital living room” where people can have intimate discussions secure from outsiders. (He emphasized the term “encrypted.”) It’s unclear how this pivot will affect Facebook’s business model, and critics have pointed out the obvious paradox of a company known for playing fast and loose with users’ data suddenly espousing privacy protection.Yet another sign that the country’s economy may be cooling: February’s disappointing jobs numbers. Only 20,000 new jobs were added, far less than the 175,000 that analysts had predicted. It’s the weakest report since September 2017, but on the upside, it still marks the 101st consecutive month of growth. Wall Street got good news this past week as regulators eased their oversight of the nation’s biggest banks. The policy shift is part of the Trump administration’s promise to call off the watchdogs put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, rules that the financial industry has criticized as hampering economic growth. While these rollbacks may help stoke markets, they could also lead to a less transparent financial system — and a repeat of past mistakes. Go back to enjoying your pasta: The Italian food impresario Mario Batali has formally exited his dining empire. More than a year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and assault, he “will no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form,” said Tanya Bastianich Manuali, who will run the remaining 16 establishments in Mr. Batali’s former portfolio. She and her brother, Mr. Batali’s erstwhile business partner Joe Bastianich, bought the disgraced chef’s shares in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group for an undisclosed sum. Mr. Batali will also hand over the keys to Eataly, the chain of Italian food emporiums. MARCH 10-16If you’ve been holding out for a Tesla that can fit your family and Elon Musk’s ego, the automaker will unveil its new crossover S.U.V., the Model Y, at the company’s Los Angeles design studio this week. Mr. Musk, the chief executive, said that the Model Y will be about 10 percent roomier than the Model 3 sedan, have slightly less battery range and come at a higher price. Tesla could certainly use the revenue boost. In its effort to sell the Model 3 for a long-promised $35,000, it’s had to lay off workers, close showrooms and cut other costs — moves that have battered its stock price. Wondering what the growing crowd of presidential candidates will be talking about this coming week, in addition to the country’s new record-high trade deficit? Well, President Trump is expected to deliver his budget proposal for 2020 this Monday, about a month late because of the government shutdown earlier this year. Lower tax revenue and increased government spending have driven up annual budget deficits, which now are expected to exceed $1 trillion starting in 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But Mr. Trump is likely to play down those numbers and focus on spending cuts instead. It’s understandable if you’ve been ignoring the Brexit commotion; all that back-and-forth was getting tedious. But now is the time to start paying attention, as talks come down to the wire. Britain’s House of Commons will vote on the latest version of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan this Tuesday. If it is rejected — as it probably will be — then Parliament will vote on whether to leave the European Union without a deal or to delay Britain’s departure beyond the original March 29 deadline. Either way, the path doesn’t look smooth, and the European Central Bank is bracing itself. On Thursday, it abruptly reversed course and revived its stimulus measures.Uber will not be held criminally liable for the death of a woman who was hit by a self-driving test car in Arizona last year, although its safety driver — who was sitting in the driver’s seat at the time of the accident — still could face charges. In other news, a new cosmetics deal has made Kylie Jenner, at 21 years old, the world’s youngest “self-made” billionaire (the “self-made” label is up for debate, but hey, the money’s real). Perhaps she’ll buy this Bugatti, which set a record last week as the world’s most expensive car at $19 million.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON — The U.S. securities watchdog's request that a federal judge hold Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk in contempt over the billionaire entrepreneur's use of Twitter was ""reasonable,"" said a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official on Monday.SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, a Democrat, told reporters at a conference in Washington that the SEC was reasonable in suggesting greater oversight of Musk's communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides. ""The idea (is) that we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from recurring,"" Jackson said.The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla's vehicle production outlook without seeking approval from its lawyers.In a Friday order, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge would allow discussions on possible sanctions. ""I understand those who are skeptical and who feel that it's innovative relief – to me it was important relief and I thought enforcement took very reasonable steps, both to the nature of the relief and our oversight of that relief,"" added Jackson of the judge's order. The SEC, which had sued Tesla, asked the company in September to consider removing Musk. The CEO agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman in an agreement that also required preapproval of Musk's written communications that could be material to the company, such as volumes of cars produced or other information likely to change the value of its securities. In a statement by Tesla on Thursday, Musk said ""the tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.""The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year. At the time the SEC also said Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla's lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose less drastic measures.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday that four members of its eleven-member board would be leaving over the next two years, as the electric car company looks to streamline its board. Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson, and Linda Johnson Rice will not be standing for re-election in the upcoming annual meetings of stockholders in 2019 and 2020, the company said https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459019012123/tsla-8k_20190418.htm in a regulatory filing. The company said its directors reviewed the composition of the board ""focusing on a phased streamlining of the size of the Board to allow it to operate more nimbly and efficiently.""Tesla said the decision did not result from any disagreement between the company and the directors.Of the four members who would exit the board, Buss and Gracias were part of Tesla's disclosure controls committee, overseeing the implementation of the terms of the consent agreement between Tesla and the SEC. Buss was also the chief financial officer of solar panel installer SolarCity for two years before retiring in 2016. Tesla bought SolarCity that year. Gracias has been an independent director at Tesla since 2010. Last May, proxy adviser ISS recommended that investors vote against his election to the board and called him a non-independent director. Jurvetson, the co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is said to be on a leave of absence from Tesla's board since allegations of sexual harassment against him arose. Jurvetson has denied the allegations against him. (https://reut.rs/2mn57in)The proposed changes in the board come a couple of weeks after Elon Musk's position as the chief executive officer of Tesla was secured after a federal judge urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter.Musk was sued by the SEC last year for tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. He settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company. But he was again accused of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Musk and the SEC would get another week to settle a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersNEW YORK — David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital renewed criticism of Elon Musk and Tesla Inc, saying the electric car company appeared to be ""on the brink"" of failure again, according to a letter sent to clients of the hedge fund on Friday.The letter cited a lack of demand, ""desperate"" price cuts, layoffs, ""closing-and-then-not-closing"" stores, closing service centres, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and ""a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA's autonomous driving capabilities."" ""We believe that right here, right now, the company appears to again be on the brink,"" the letter said. Greenlight is short Tesla stock, recently a profitable bet. Tesla's share price declined from $332.80 to $279.86 in the first quarter. On Friday, shares of Tesla were trading around $268 per share.Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Greenlight said its funds gained 11 percent over the first three months of 2019, slightly below the gain of the S&P 500 Index. Despite the gains so far this year, ""it continued to be a challenging environment for our investment style with growth stocks performing much better than value stocks,"" the letter said.""In the context of this headwind and a sizable short portfolio, we are pleased with the quarterly result,"" it added.Greenlight noted that last summer, Musk had promised Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in every quarter going forward. ""He repeated that forecast as recently as the end of January,"" Greenlight said.""That promise has failed to materialise. The question at hand is: in a few months will Musk be again bragging that he saved the company from the brink of failure, or will TSLA in fact fail this time?""Greenlight Capital and its founder Einhorn first rose to prominence for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers’ accounting troubles before the firm’s collapse. Late last year, Greenlight compared Tesla to Lehman. In Greenlight's letter, Einhorn said the fund's biggest gainers during the first quarter included AerCap Holdings, Brighthouse Financial, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, General Motors and Green Brick Partners.Einhorn said Brighthouse has been misunderstood because GAAP accounting requires that hedges get marked to market each quarter while liabilities are not. ""This creates a mismatch between how BHF's assets and liabilities are treated in response to market moves,"" Einhorn said. ""All else being equal, BHF benefits from rising equity markets and higher interest rates, as the economic gain from lower expected claims more than offsets the company's losses on its hedges.""

It is still our main route to the heavens, at least for now.As these photos suggest, time has since put a wrinkle or two or three on the massive Baikonur Cosmodrome, some 1,300 miles southeast of Moscow.It was at Baikonur that the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, shocking America and beginning the space race in earnest. The United States worked furiously to catch up to, and eventually surpass, the Soviet program. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin left Baikonur for a single orbit of the Earth.Today, Russians, Americans and travelers from other nations team up on missions launched from the Baikonur site, described by Vladimir V. Putin six years ago as “physically aged.” Besides all the liftoffs, Baikonur serves as a tourist draw, offering a museum, tours and even an opportunity to take a zero gravity flight.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]On Dec. 3, the crew of Soyuz MS-11 — with Anne McClain of the United States, Oleg Kononenko of Russia and David Saint-Jacques of Canada — took off for the International Space Station. On Thursday, two more Americans and a Russian will travel there. One of the Americans on that trip, Christina Koch, plans to join Ms. McClain in the first all-female spacewalk.Since the final space shuttle flight in 2011, American astronauts have had to hitch rides on Russian ships to get to the space station. NASA’s current strategy is to use private companies — Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Boeing — to carry Americans into space. Mr. Musk, fresh from a successful uncrewed launch this month, hopes this year to end Baikonur’s status as the exclusive provider of human travel to the space station.Advertisement"

" AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX launched its second supersized rocket and for the first time landed all three boosters Thursday, a year after sending up a sports car on the initial test flight.The new and improved Falcon Heavy thundered into the early evening sky with a communication satellite called Arabsat, the rocket's first paying customer. The Falcon Heavy is the most powerful rocket in use today, with 27 engines firing at liftoff — nine per booster.Eight minutes after liftoff, SpaceX landed two of the first-stage boosters back at Cape Canaveral, side by side, just like it did for the rocket's debut last year. The core booster landed two minutes later on an ocean platform hundreds of miles offshore. That's the only part of the first mission that missed.""What an amazing day,"" a SpaceX flight commentator exclaimed. ""Three for three boosters today on Falcon Heavy, what an amazing accomplishment.""The Falcon Heavy soared from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, using the same pad that shot Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago and later space shuttle crews.Nearby beaches and other prime viewing spots were packed with tourists and locals eager to catch not just the launch but the rare and dramatic return of twin boosters, accompanied by sonic booms. The roads were also jammed for Wednesday night's launch attempt, which was scuttled by high wind.Because this was an upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes, SpaceX chief Elon Musk cautioned in advance things might go wrong. But everything went exceedingly well and the satellite ended up in the proper orbit. SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheered every launch milestone and especially the three touchdowns.""The Falcons have landed,"" Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters.NASA offered swift congratulations. ""From our iconic launch pads at @NASAKennedy, we will continue to support the growing commercial space economy,"" NASA tweeted. Musk replied with three red hearts.Musk put his own Tesla convertible on last year's demo. The red Roadster — with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, likely still at the wheel — remains in a solar orbit stretching just past Mars.The Roadster is thought to be on the other side of the sun from us right now, about three-quarters of the way around its first solar orbit, said Jon Giorgini, a senior analyst at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.A couple dozen ground telescopes kept tabs on the car during its first several days in space, but it gradually faded from view as it headed out toward the orbit of Mars, Giorgini noted.The Roadster could still look much the same as it did for the Feb. 6, 2018, launch, just not as shiny with perhaps some chips and flakes from the extreme temperature swings, according to Giorgini. It will take decades if not centuries for solar radiation to cause it to decompose, he said.SpaceX plans to launch its next Falcon Heavy later this year on a mission for the U.S. Air Force. The boosters for that flight may be recycled from this one.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine last month suggested possibly using a Falcon Heavy — and another company's big rocket — to get the space agency's Orion capsule around the moon, minus a crew, in 2020. But the preferred method remains NASA's own Space Launch System mega rocket — if it can be ready by then.Bridenstine said everything is on the space table as NASA strives to meet the White House's goal of landing astronauts back on the moon by 2024.NASA's Saturn V rockets, used for the Apollo moon shots, are the all-time launch leaders so far in size and might.SpaceX typically launches Falcon 9 rockets. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of those single rockets strapped together.Until SpaceX came along, boosters were discarded in the ocean after satellite launches. The company is intent on driving down launch costs by recycling rocket parts.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Here’s your cheat sheet. FEB. 24-MarCH 2If you didn’t spend your Wednesday glued to the riveting testimony of Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, you’ve no doubt heard the more salacious details by now (hush money to a porn star, etc.). But Mr. Cohen also made new accusations about his former client’s business practices. He said that Mr. Trump inflated his net worth to qualify for bigger bank loans, misrepresented the value of properties to avoid taxes and exaggerated the value of his assets when insuring them — in other words, committed fraud. Those revelations could pose problems not only for Mr. Trump, but also for his inner circle, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, went rogue on Twitter — again. The Securities and Exchange Commission wants to hold him in contempt of court for tweeting about production forecasts last week, which violated the terms of a settlement he made with the agency last year. (The S.E.C. sued him over misleading Twitter posts about taking his company private, and his legal team is now supposed to review any tweets with material information before he sends them — which didn’t happen, in this case.) In related news, Tesla is finally taking orders for the long-promised $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan. But it had to cut significant costs in other areas — like in its work force — to do so. Hopefully, they can still be friends. Gap Inc. said on Thursday that it would split into two companies, one that’s just Old Navy — the star moneymaker — and the other containing Gap, Banana Republic, and the newer labels Athleta and Hill City. Gap the brand has been dragging down Gap the company for quite some time (its sales fell 5 percent last year) while Old Navy has grown like gangbusters and can now proceed unfettered. So what’s Gap doing wrong? Analysts say it failed to hold onto the baby boomers who loved its turtlenecks and jeans in the ’90s, while millennials are turning to cheaper options — and Old Navy has the better deals. MARCH 3-9American farmers are bearing the brunt of the China trade war, defaulting on their loans at the highest rate in nine years. But Mr. Trump has said he’s anticipating “some very big news over the next week or two” about a deal. Last Friday was supposed to be the hard deadline for an agreement between the two governments, or else Mr. Trump would raise tariffs on Beijing to more punitive levels. But the administration backed off its big-stick posturing last week, dropping the deadline in light of “significant progress” in negotiations. Mr. Trump’s advisers were more cautiously optimistic about striking a deal, while many members of Congress remain skeptical of its terms. What better name for a new spacecraft than “Crew Dragon”? NASA and SpaceX are sending the capsule on its maiden voyage to the International Space Station this week. No humans are aboard this test flight, but ultimately the Crew Dragon is intended to carry astronauts — making it the first passenger-friendly ship that NASA has launched since the Atlantis space shuttle completed its final mission in 2011. Since then, NASA has had to buy rides to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft, an arrangement that the Crew Dragon is expected to end. It looks weird, and it should — it’s artwork “curated” by artificial intelligence, and it will be the first of its medium sold at auction this Wednesday at Sotheby’s. Created by the artist Mario Klingemann, the installation consists of two framed screens that use neural networks to “think” for themselves, shifting into an endless stream of (rather creepy) portraits that the machine “imagines” in real time. No two faces that it depicts are alike, so every viewer gets a unique show. The piece is expected to fetch up to $52,000 — and perhaps whet the art market’s appetite for more of its kind. HBO’s chief executive, Richard Plepler, who ushered in a heyday for cable with shows like “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City,” abruptly stepped down after 27 years at the network. Millions of people in Uganda have quit the internet after the government imposed taxes on the use of social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. Walmart is doing away with its greeters — those people in blue vests who stand at the store entrance and seem way too happy to see you — which may put many employees with disabilities out of a job. And a new report showed that economic growth in the United States is not as peppy as some people (including Mr. Trump) predicted, as the effects of tax cuts and other economic stimuli fade.Advertisement"

" AdvertisementSupported byThe Crew Dragon capsule carried no crew, but it sets up a near future with astronauts traveling to orbit from the United States again.By Kenneth ChangThe first American spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts since the retirement of the space shuttles launched early Saturday. A successful mission could put NASA and the United States on the cusp of a renewed era of human spaceflight.There were no people on this demonstration flight, a SpaceX vehicle called Crew Dragon. As lightning sparked in distant skies, the spacecraft lifted off at the appointed time, 2:49 a.m. Eastern Time, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida. Within 10 minutes the capsule was in orbit, headed toward a Sunday morning rendezvous with the International Space Station.LIFTOFF! The next big leap in a new chapter of U.S. human spaceflight  systems has left the pad. @SpaceX’s #CrewDragon demo flight will be the 1st  commercially-built & operated American spacecraft designed for humans to dock at the @Space_Station. Watch: https://t.co/Fm5NQSfAXJ pic.twitter.com/YoiOf67kQL“Tonight was a big night for the United States of America, a great night for NASA,” Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, said during a news conference after the launch.The launch was also an important step for the goals of Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 and who says the objective of the company is to send people to space and eventually Mars. “It's been 17 years to get to this point,” said Mr. Musk. He described himself as emotionally exhausted. “But it worked,” Mr. Musk said of Crew Dragon. “So far.”[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]To date, the company has sent into space only satellites and cargo (and one Tesla sports car). “We still haven't launched anyone yet, but hopefully, we will later this year,” Mr. Musk said. “So that would definitely be a culmination of a long dream for a lot of people, me and a lot of people at SpaceX.”For the past eight years, NASA has been paying for rides on Russian spacecraft to get its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Instead of developing and operating its own replacement for the space shuttles, NASA has instead turned to private companies to provide that service. In 2014, the space agency awarded two contracts, to SpaceX and to Boeing.The mission that launched Saturday, known as Demo-1, is an end-to-end test of the spacecraft from launch to docking at the International Space Station to re-entering over the United States and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.The capsule is to arrive at the space station on Sunday, about 27 hours after launch. Unlike earlier SpaceX missions that took cargo to the space station, which approached from below and was then grabbed by the station’s robotic arm, the Crew Dragon capsule will approach from the front and autonomously dock.After five days at the station, it is scheduled to leave on March 8.Mr. Musk said the most critical portions of the mission are the docking and the re-entry. The Crew Dragon’s top half has a more complex shape compared with an earlier version of SpaceX’s capsule that only carries cargo. That could cause it to tumble in the atmosphere.“I think it’s unlikely,” Mr. Musk said. “We’ve run simulations a thousand times. But this is a possibility.”The capsule can seat up to seven astronauts, although the early flights will not fill to capacity. For this demonstration flight, one of the four seats is occupied with a sort of artificial person — what NASA calls an A.T.D. or “anthropomorphic test device” — which is wearing a SpaceX spacesuit. The device includes sensors to measure forces and accelerations that a person would experience on the trip.The SpaceX engineers named it Ripley, after the heroine in the Alien movies played by Sigourney Weaver. The Ripley dummy was accompanied by a plush globe intended to signal when the capsule’s occupants became weightless. Video footage in a tweet by Mr. Musk showed the toy lifting from its seat during orbit.It is also carrying 400 pounds of cargo as well as inserts that simulate the mass of a more completely-filled capsule. Engineers on the ground will use information from the flight to understand how the spacecraft responds to being filled.NASA officials say that they expect that not everything will work perfectly; the purpose of the demonstration flight is to identify potential problems, and fix them, before putting people aboard.SpaceX has another high-stakes uncrewed test scheduled for June. The same capsule will again launch on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, but the flight will simulate a malfunction in the rocket high in the atmosphere. The escape system is to then propel the capsule to safety.If that test succeeds, then perhaps as soon as July, two NASA astronauts, Robert L. Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley, are to make a demonstration flight to the space station. “Seeing a success like this definitely gives us a lot of confidence in the future,” Mr. Behnken said at the news conference. Operational missions carrying four astronauts would then follow.The first crewless test flight of Boeing’s capsule, Starliner, could occur as soon as next month and a first crewed flight could also take off this year.However, after years of delays, the schedules for Boeing and SpaceX could still slip further if additional technical issues arise. NASA is considering buying more Russian Soyuz seats should crewed flights not occur this year.Kenneth Chang has been at The Times since 2000, writing about physics, geology, chemistry, and the planets.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLOS ANGELES — The world's largest aircraft took off over the Mojave Desert in California on Saturday, the first flight for the carbon-composite plane built by Stratolaunch Systems Corp, started by late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, as the company enters the lucrative private space market. The white airplane called Roc, which has a wingspan the length of an American football field and is powered by six engines on a twin fuselage, took to the air shortly before 7 a.m. Pacific time (1400 GMT) and stayed aloft for more than two hours before landing safely back at the Mojave Air and Space Port as a crowd of hundreds of people cheered.""What a fantastic first flight,"" Stratolaunch Chief Executive Officer Jean Floyd said in a statement posted to the company's website. ""Today’s flight furthers our mission to provide a flexible alternative to ground launched systems, Floyd said. ""We are incredibly proud of the Stratolaunch team, today’s flight crew, our partners at Northrup Grumman’s Scaled Composites and the Mojave Air and Space Port.""The plane is designed to drop rockets and other space vehicles weighing up to 500,000 pounds at an altitude of 35,000 feet and has been billed by the company as making satellite deployment as ""easy as booking an airline flight.""Saturday's flight, which saw the plane reach a maximum speed of 189 miles per hour and altitudes of 17,000 feet, was meant to test its performance and handling qualities, according to Stratolaunch. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, announced in 2011 that he had formed the privately funded Stratolaunch.The company seeks to cash in on higher demand in coming years for vessels that can put satellites in orbit, competing in the United States with other space entrepreneurs and industry stalwarts such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and United Launch Alliance - a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Stratolaunch has said that it intends to launch its first rockets from the Roc in 2020 at the earliest. Allen died in October 2018 while suffering from non-Hodgkins' lymphoma, just months after the plane's development was unveiled. ""We all know Paul would have been proud to witness today’s historic achievement,"" said Jody Allen, Chair of Vulcan Inc and Trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust.

Zoom Video Communications soared 72% while Pinterest jumped 28% when they started trading. The strong initial performances might reassure investors with jittery nerves following Lyft's disappointing start less than a month ago.___National Enquirer being sold to former newsstand mogulNEW YORK (AP) — The National Enquirer is being sold to the former head of the airport newsstand company Hudson News. Tabloid owner American Media say it is selling the supermarket weekly to James Cohen, the former head of newsstand retailer Hudson News. The deal comes after a rocky year for the tabloid in which it was caught up in a federal probe of illegal campaign contributions to Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.___Commission: New NAFTA would deliver modest economic gainsWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's new North America trade agreement would give the U.S. economy only a modest boost, an independent federal agency reports. The International Trade Commission says that Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement would lift the U.S. economy by 0.35%, or $68.2 billion, and add 176,000 jobs six years after it takes effect.___Musk, SEC get another week to reach deal in contempt caseNEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and U.S. securities regulators are getting another week to negotiate a deal to keep Musk from being found in contempt of court. Both sides say in a letter filed Thursday with a federal court in New York that they talked for over an hour this week and are continuing to discuss an agreement. District Judge Alison Nathan granted the request to talk until April 25.___US retail sales soared 1.6% in MarchWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. retail sales surged in March at the fastest pace since late 2017, as spending on autos, gasoline, furniture and clothing jumped. The Commerce Department says that sales increased a seasonally adjusted 1.6% from February, the strongest increase since September 2017. The gains mark a sharp rebound from a lackluster period of sales dating back to December. It's a sign that the healthy job market has likely made consumers more eager to spend in ways that boost overall economic growth.___Americans' energy use surges despite climate change concernWASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are burning a record amount of energy, led by a boom in natural gas.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Zach WichterGeneral Motors is moving to widen its lineup of electric cars, and adding jobs in the process.The automaker said Friday that it would begin producing a new electric vehicle as part of its Chevrolet lineup, resulting in the addition of 400 jobs at its plant in Orion Township, Mich.The vehicle will share some characteristics with the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV, a small wagon that is already produced at the Orion factory, the company said in a statement. The addition of the vehicle will be accompanied by an investment in the plant of about $300 million. The company did not offer any other details about the new vehicle.G.M. has said since 2017 that it planned to substantially expand its lineup of all-electric cars. The push comes as other carmakers, including Hyundai and Audi, prepare to unveil new plug-in hybrids and fully electric models in a bet that car owners are ready to switch from gasoline-powered vehicles.“It’s an ongoing story of just trying to get realigned with where they see the business going in the future,” said Jeff Windau, an equity analyst at Edward Jones. “This is a capital-intensive business, and it takes time for the investments to be made and for the products to start being manufactured.”In an appearance on CNBC, G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said it would take one or two years for the new vehicle to reach the market.Competition in the electric-vehicle market is increasing. Ford announced this week that it would invest $900 million in Michigan to increase production of autonomous and electric cars in the coming years.Both G.M. and Ford seem to be trying to chip away at Tesla’s hold on the electric vehicle market. Even as Elon Musk’s company expands its fleet, its sales seem to be slowing. A federal tax credit for electric vehicles was recently reduced for Tesla buyers after the company reached a sales threshold, but customers buying electric vehicles from other automakers still qualify for the higher reimbursement.G.M. announced its new vehicle several days after President Trump criticized the automaker on Twitter over its decision to end production at a factory in Lordstown, Ohio. The plant is one of five in North America that the company said in November it would idle as part of a broader effort to cut costs.G.M. said Friday that it had around 2,700 job openings at its factories and that it was trying to fill the vacancies with employees affected by the shutdowns at Lordstown and elsewhere. The company said 1,100 employees from idled plants had already been placed at other factories.Advertisement"

But in a lengthy LinkedIn post, the Bridgewater Associates founder says that it isn’t working anymore.• Mr. Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism “evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it’s producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots.”• “Disparity in wealth, especially when accompanied by disparity in values, leads to increasing conflict and, in the government, that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another.”• “The problem is that capitalists typically don’t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don’t know how to grow it well.”• “We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large.”• “It doesn’t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals, it needs to be reformed.”Stay tuned: Mr. Dalio says that he’ll offer his solutions in another essay.A federal judge gave Elon Musk and the S.E.C. two weeks to resolve a dispute about whether Mr. Musk violated a settlement he reached with the commission, Matthew Goldstein of the NYT reports.Mr. Musk’s tweeting is at the heart of the skirmish. The S.E.C. says that a tweet about Tesla production numbers violated the settlement, in which he promised to get approval from a Tesla lawyer before publishing any Twitter posts that include potentially market-sensitive information.His lawyers insist that the tweet didn’t contain material information. One of them said yesterday that the S.E.C.’s policy on what needs to be vetted was “murky.” Judge Alison Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan wondered if there was a “lack of clarity” and whether the settlement should be modified or struck down.“Take a deep breath,” Judge Nathan told both sides. She added that they should put on “their reasonableness pants” to find common ground.This is “something of a victory for Mr. Musk, who could have been fined if he was found to be in contempt,” Mr. Goldstein writes. But Judge Nathan told Mr. Musk that, regardless of how powerful a person he is, a “court order is not optional.”More: Tesla shares fell after it reported delivering fewer vehicles than expected in the first quarter. And the automaker’s electric vehicle competition appears to be catching up.Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos said yesterday that they had finalized their divorce — and she will keep a big chunk of the Amazon empire.Mr. Bezos will keep 75 percent of the couple’s Amazon stock — which means he will hold about 12 percent of the company’s shares — as well as their family’s ownership interests in the WaPo and the Blue Origin space exploration company. That’s enough to keep his title as the world’s richest man.More important for him, he’ll keep voting control of Ms. Bezos’s shares. Even if she sells them, the recipient has to agree to hand over voting rights to Mr. Bezos.Ms. Bezos could have been entitled to half of the couple’s holdings under Washington State law, according to legal experts. It’s not clear what other compensation she is receiving from the split.But her holdings are valued at about $36 billion, making her one of the wealthiest women in the world. In her first-ever tweet, Ms. Bezos wrote, “Excited about my own plans. Grateful for the past as I look forward to what comes next.”Initial findings from an investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month suggest that Boeing didn’t give pilots enough guidance on new anti-stall software in the 737 Max 8.The Ethiopian Airlines pilots followed Boeing’s instructions when the anti-stall system kicked in, the report suggests. They then shut down the software and tried to retake control — but failed to do so. Four minutes later, the plane crashed.The system appeared to have forced the plane’s nose down several times in less than three minutes. It “left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full limit,” Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for American Airlines’s pilots union, told the NYT. “It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,” Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s C.E.O., said yesterday. “We own it, and we know how to do it.” Boeing has found a second software flaw in the 737 Max 8, separate from the anti-stall feature. The FT reports that this was the reason for a delay in rolling out software fixes for the plane.President Trump reportedly hoped to announce a final trade agreement between the U.S. and China yesterday. But he stopped short of that, Anna Swanson of the NYT reports, instead saying that it may take at least four more weeks to secure an “epic” trade deal.• “The United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues, including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed, and when.”• “In remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said that the deal was ‘very complete’ and that the two sides had ‘agreed to far more than we have left to agree to.’ ”• “I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to,” Mr. Trump added.Yet no matter what, Mr. Trump can already claim a trade victory. “Spurred by tariffs and trade tensions, global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from China, just as some Trump administration officials had wanted,” Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes.Herman Cain, the former C.E.O. of the Godfather’s Pizza chain and a presidential hopeful in 2012, may soon become President Trump’s next pick as a Fed governor.Mr. Cain is perhaps best remembered for his 2012 run for president, when he proposed an unorthodox “9-9-9” economic plan: a flat 9 percent tax rate, 9 percent business tax and 9 percent national sales tax.But Mr. Trump wants him on the Fed, calling him “a truly outstanding individual.” His nomination is dependent on the White House vetting process.Mr. Trump’s pick comes as the president has soured on the Fed. The president has told associates that selecting Jay Powell as the Fed’s chairman was a mistake, because of his insistence on raising interest rates.But the president’s Fed choices are drawing brickbats. Like Stephen Moore, the economics commentator whom Mr. Trump has already nominated for a place on the Fed board, Mr. Cain doesn’t have what critics say are the requisite qualifications.Critics worry that Mr. Trump is politicizing the Fed, which is meant to be apolitical. The possible nominations of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain have “the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy,” Sarah Bloom Raskin, a Fed governor under President Barack Obama, told the NYT.JPMorgan Chase released its annual report to investors yesterday, and it included a long letter from Jamie Dimon about the bank’s role in shaping America.The biggest problems facing the U.S., according to Mr. Dimon, include education, immigration, health care costs, cyberattacks and “excessive regulation.”Capitalism is under pressure, but it’s better than socialism, he argues. “Socialism inevitably produces stagnation, corruption and often worse,” Mr. Dimon writes. But the JPMorgan chief also distinguishes social democrats, which some Democrats identify as, from true socialists.C.E.O.s and companies should be more active in public life, Mr. Dimon writes, “particularly when they or their companies can uniquely help design policies that are good for America.”To respond, JPMorgan plans to strengthen its public policy teams “to take our advocacy and ideas to the next level,” he writes.More: Jamie Dimon reportedly spent much of last year considering a run for president — but decided there was no way a Wall Street C.E.O. could win.Rudy Giuliani, who was President Trump’s personal lawyer during the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, is a very busy man, according to Stephanie Baker of Bloomberg Businessweek.• Mr. Giuliani runs “a globe-trotting consulting business,” Ms. Baker writes. “In the past two years he’s given speeches and done consulting and legal work in Armenia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Turkey, and Uruguay, among other countries,” as well as significant work in Ukraine.• But “the question of conflict arises, in part, because Giuliani keeps popping up in world capitals to make pronouncements that dovetail with Trump’s foreign policy positions.”• Mr. Giuliani says he tells clients that he doesn’t lobby the U.S. government. “ ‘There’s no conflict. What’s the conflict?’ he said. ‘I don’t ask the president for anything for them ever.’ He later added, ‘I don’t peddle influence. I don’t have to. I make a good deal of money as a lawyer and as a security consultant.’ ”• “Whatever he does next, whether it’s continuing as Trump’s personal lawyer or going back to full-time consulting, Giuliani is confident the business will continue to flow. ‘I got clients before I represented President Trump, and I’m gonna get clients afterwards,’ he said. ‘After I stop representing him, I’ll be doing more work overseas, because I’ll have more time.’ ”The World Bank’s board is reportedly expected to approve David Malpass as its president today.Lars Idermark resigned as Swedbank’s chairman amid an investigation into alleged money laundering at the Swedish lender.President Trump plans to nominate Jovita Carranza, the U.S. treasurer, as his pick to lead the Small Business Administration, potentially replacing Linda McMahon.The Senate confirmed Mark Calabria, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief economist, as Mr. Trump’s pick to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Deals• The company created to hold Yahoo’s $50 billion stake in the Alibaba Group plans to finally dissolve itself and distribute its holdings.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)DealBook exclusive: The energy company plans to announce today that it has given $5 million to Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on making corporate America more hospitable toward women.It’s funding Men Advocating Real Change, a Catalyst campaign that teaches male executives how to improve diversity and inclusion at their companies. (Among its tactics: lessons on unconscious bias.) Lorraine Hariton, Catalyst’s C.E.O., said it was the single biggest grant in the nonprofit’s 50-year history.Chevron has been a longtime supporter of Catalyst. It began working with the nonprofit 20 years ago, and Mike Wirth, the oil and gas giant’s C.E.O., helped introduce this program to the company two years ago. It now runs in seven Chevron offices worldwide.Diversity and inclusion has improved at Chevron. In 2010, only 6 percent of its board and 11 percent of its management committee were women. Now, it’s 36 percent for the board and 20 percent for the management committee. “I think the business case for this is compelling,” Mr. Wirth told Michael de la Merced of DealBook, saying more diversity has improved innovation.But there’s still a lot to do. Mr. Wirth said that oil and gas needed far more women in engineering and technical roles. And Ms. Hariton said that while companies have been hiring more women, the number of top female executives remains too small.President Trump is facing increasing pressure from Republicans, Democrats and even some of his own advisers to win the kind of large concessions that Beijing has long resisted, Alan Rappeport of the NYT writes.Mr. Trump has softened his threats against China. “Citing ‘substantial progress’ in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week,” Mr. Rappeport explains.But the Chinese may be dangling false promises, some top Democrats say, in hopes of ending a trade war that is damaging their economy, as well as hurting American farmers. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit and offers relief to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.Many big sticking points remain, including China’s state subsidies for its businesses. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administration’s demands over intellectual property and cybertheft.“The blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim he’s being tough on China, analysts said,” according to Mr. Rappeport.More: The FT imagines what a trade deal might look like. Trade war is only one of the threats worrying President Xi Jinping of Chin. U.S. companies are planning their lowest rate of expansion in China since 2016. And a delay on further tariffs probably staved off inflation in America.The Securities and Exchange Commission says a series of tweets Elon Musk published last week violate its agreement with Tesla, and wants him held in contempt of court.Mr. Musk got in trouble last year by tweeting that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, when that wasn’t exactly the case. Tesla settled, promising the S.E.C. that it would set up “mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk’s Tesla-related written communications.”Then last week, he tweeted about a manufacturing triumph, saying Tesla would make “around 500,000” cars this year, up from a target of 400,000. He soon corrected himself and repeated the target of 400,000 deliveries. Tesla’s lawyers conceded that Mr. Musk hadn’t had his tweets reviewed, but argued “the substance” of his post had already been vetted and publicly disclosed. Mr. Musk followed up by needling the S.E.C., tweeting that it “forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript,” in which he forecast production of between 350,000 and 500,000 cars. “How embarrassing,” he added.“This is not an innocuous tweet,” Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, told the NYT. “Insiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public.”Punishments the S.E.C. could seek, Ms. Roiphe said, include a fine, more restrictions on Mr. Musk’s social media use, or even his removal as C.E.O.With just over a month to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U., Prime Minister Theresa May could U-turn on her commitment to keeping to schedule. And the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, under heavy pressure, has promised to support a second public vote.Mrs. May is letting her cabinet think the unthinkable. The prime minister, who has repeatedly insisted that Brexit will occur on March 29, will allow her colleagues “to discuss extending the deadline” today, according to Bloomberg, which sets out what she’d be risking and why:• “On one hand, it would avert mass resignations from pro-E.U. ministers in May’s team, and potentially a defeat in Parliament this week.”• “But it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from Euroskeptic Conservatives.”And Mr. Corbyn has made a big concession to pro-Europeans. He had long resisted a second Brexit referendum, but has had to reconsider after several pro-E.U. lawmakers quit his Labour Party. Stephen Castle of the NYT explains what the reversal means:• “At the moment, it is unlikely that a second vote would win a majority in Parliament because most lawmakers still oppose the idea.”• “But if Mrs. May’s Brexit plan is rejected next month for a second time, then the calculation in Parliament could change.”Dozens of current and former employees of a company called Cognizant, which reviews content for the social network, spoke to the Verge. The investigation makes for grim reading:• “Employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions.”• “In stark contrast to the perks lavished on Facebook employees, team leaders micromanage content moderators’ every bathroom and prayer break,” and employees “have been found having sex inside stairwells.”• “They are pressured not to discuss the emotional toll that their job takes on them, even with loved ones, leading to increased feelings of isolation and anxiety.”• “Moderators told me it’s a place where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace fringe views. One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the Earth is flat.”• “Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year — while the average Facebook employee has a total compensation of $240,000.” Facebook’s response: In a statement yesterday, it said it was “putting in place a rigorous and regular compliance and audit process for all of our outsourced partners to ensure they are complying with the contracts and care we expect.”Bank of America plans to erase the Merrill Lynch name from its investment banking and trading arms. They’ll go by “BofA Securities” rather than “Bank of America Merrill Lynch,” and its wealth-management unit will be “Merrill.”It’s the end of an era. Merrill Lynch was one of the best-known names on Wall Street when Bank of America bought it during the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, Bank of America was a big lender, built from years of acquisitions — but a minnow in high finance.The combined firm struggled with culture clashes. Longtime Merrill employees were proud of “Mother Merrill” and the “thundering herd” that was its wealth-management arm. The WSJ reports that Bank of America backed away from changing the name before.But now it wants a seamless identity. “We are continuing to unify the company, continuing down the road we started on a decade ago,” Bank of America’s C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, told the WSJ. (He has also pushed the firm into safe businesses, de-emphasizing the risk-taking that left Merrill needing a buyer.)The only place where staying as Merrill made sense was in wealth management. Mr. Moynihan called it “the No. 1 brand there is.”Last year, President Trump replaced Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve. Since, Mr. Trump has broken with precedent by publicly criticizing Mr. Powell for raising interest rates. Ms. Yellen has now made clear what she thinks of all that in an interview with Marketplace.• When the host of Marketplace, Kai Ryssdal, asked if she thought the president “has a grasp of macroeconomic policy,” Ms. Yellen replied, “No, I do not.”• When asked to elaborate, she said, “Well, I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed’s goals are maximum employment and price stability.”• “He’s made comments about the Fed having an exchange rate objective in order to support his trade plans, or possibly targeting the U.S. balance of trade,” she added. “And, you know, I think comments like that shows a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals.”Amazon added the former PepsiCo C.E.O.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersTOKYO/BENGALURU — Panasonic Corp and Tesla Inc will continue to make new investments in the U.S. electric carmaker's Gigafactory as needed, but believe they can squeeze more out of existing resources than previously planned, Tesla said on Thursday.Separately, Panasonic said it was watching the demand situation in the electric car market before making any further investments in expanding the capacity of the Nevada plant.The two companies were responding to a report by Japan's Nikkei that said they had frozen previous plans to raise the capacity of the plant, which supplies battery packs for Tesla cars.""Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory,"" a Tesla spokesperson said.""That said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated.""Giving no details of its sources, the Nikkei reported https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Tesla-and-Panasonic-freeze-spending-on-4.5bn-Gigafactory that financial issues had led the companies to rethink plans to expand the capacity of Gigafactory 1 by another 50 percent next year.The business daily said the companies had already together invested $4.5 billion in the facility and had been planning to expand the plant's capacity to the equivalent of 54 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year in 2020 from 35 GWh at present.""Panasonic established a battery production capacity of 35 GWh in Tesla's Gigafactory 1 by the end of March 2019 in line with growing demand,"" Japan-based Panasonic said in an email. ""Watching the demand situation, Panasonic will study additional investments over 35 GWh in collaboration with Tesla.""Neither company had made public detailed future development plans for the site, although Panasonic said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panasonic-batteries-idUSKBN1JS08J in July last year it would consider further investment in the Gigafactory if requested by the U.S. electric carmaker.Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, which in turn is Panasonic's biggest EV battery client. In February, Tesla said it had agreed to buy U.S. energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc, sending shares in Panasonic lower.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk also said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at its new Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.The Nikkei report said Panasonic would also suspend its planned investment in Tesla's new Shanghai plant and would instead provide technical support and a small number of batteries from the Gigafactory.The Japanese company has only said that it was studying various possibilities with regards to the plant.Lower-than-expected car deliveries by Tesla in the first quarter spooked stock and bond investors earlier this month, adding to Wall Street's concerns about its future cashflow.Tesla is expected to report first-quarter earnings on April 24.

" AdvertisementSupported byIt was only the second flight for what is the most powerful rocket now available on Earth, improving on its spectacular test launch in 2018.By Kenneth ChangThe Falcon Heavy roared into space on Thursday night, arcing atop three columns of flame toward orbit with a large satellite on board.It was the second launch for what is the most powerful rocket in operation today, a reminder of its majestic test launch fourteen months ago from the same launchpad, 39A, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]At moments, the 2018 launch seemed like a lengthy advertisement for the ambitions of Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and chief executive. It carried a spacesuit-wearing mannequin, nicknamed Starman, seated in the driver’s seat of a red Roadster built by Mr. Musk’s other company, Tesla. The sports car and its driver streamed video back to Earth of their journey out into the solar system.This time, the Falcon Heavy’s cargo was more mundane, but also more useful: Arabsat-6A, a Saudi Arabian communications satellite which will relay television, internet and mobile phone signals to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.Shortly after the launch, the rocket’s three boosters returned to Earth. Two touched down seconds apart at landing pads at Cape Canaveral, not far from the launchpad. The center booster, which went higher and farther, set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean. Sticking that third landing was an advancement for SpaceX, after a similar maneuver failed in 2018 on the first try. The booster then missed the platform, hitting the water at more than 300 miles per hour. The company’s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket, which first launched in 2010. The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together. The second stages of the two rockets are identical. The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift.On the test flight, the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights. (SpaceX’s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching it again; traditionally, rockets have been one-use throwaways, with the booster stages dropped into the ocean.)For this one, the side boosters had never before been used. They were the latest version of the rocket, called “Block Five.” (“Block” is what rocket companies call a major upgrade.) That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry.Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless, SpaceX probably made adjustments. That, after all, is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design.SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly. It launched 20 Falcon 9 missions in 2018, more than in any previous year, in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch. The company was also busy at work developing its Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned. When Mr. Musk first announced the rocket in 2011, he said he expected that there would be a 50/50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In the years since, improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful, and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites.The Falcon Heavy is now needed for only the largest satellites like the 13,000-pound Arabsat-6A satellite, which is headed to geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles above Earth. The satellite could have been launched on a Falcon 9, but with the added thrust of a Heavy, the satellite could use less of its own fuel to reach its final orbit, extending its lifetime.SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the second time on Thursday.One more Falcon Heavy flight is scheduled for this year — a mission for the United States Air Force carrying 25 small satellites.In addition, SpaceX has announced contracts for two Falcon Heavy launches of commercial satellites, and the company has won two competitions to use the rocket for national security missions.At present, no, but that answer could change.In 2017, SpaceX announced that two space tourists would go on an around-the-moon trip in one of the company’s Crew Dragon capsules launched by a Falcon Heavy. But when the first Heavy reached the launchpad last year, SpaceX said it had decided not to go to the expense and effort of making the rocket safe enough for launching people.The possibility of using the Falcon Heavy for lunar missions was revived last month by Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, when he told a Senate committee that the big rocket that his agency is developing, the Space Launch System, would not be ready for its first test flight in 2020. NASA was looking into using commercial rockets as an alternative, he said.One of the alternatives was putting the second stage of the Space Launch System on top of a Falcon Heavy first stage. Mr. Bridenstine later said that option was feasible but could not be done by next year, because major changes would be needed to the boosters and SpaceX’s launchpad to accommodate the Frankenstein rocket combination. Mr. Bridenstine, however, left the door open, saying that NASA would explore all options to meet the Trump administrations goal of sending astronauts back to the moon by the end of 2024.SpaceX’s next-generation rocket was once known as B.F.R. where “B” stood for “big” and “R” stood for “rocket.” It now has the less colorful name Starship. SpaceX has begun small hop tests of a preliminary design, nicknamed Starhopper. The full-fledged design is to reach orbit and eventually make distant journeys to the moon and Mars, but that is still years away.One of Starship’s first passengers is to be Yusaku Maezawa, founder of the online Japanese clothing company Zozo. Mr. Maezawa had been one of the lunar tourists who had signed up for the Falcon Heavy trip around the moon but now will wait longer for the even larger rocket.Kenneth Chang has been at The Times since 2000, writing about physics, geology, chemistry, and the planets. Before becoming a science writer, he was a graduate student whose research involved the control of chaos.  @kchangnyt Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)A federal appeals court ruled against the Justice Department on its bid to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. It’s the final blow to the government’s two-year effort to thwart one of the biggest media mergers in years.A three-judge panel ruled that a lower court had applied antitrust laws correctly. “The government’s objections that the District Court misunderstood and misapplied economic principles and clearly erred in rejecting the quantitative model are unpersuasive,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote on behalf of the panel.AT&T is free to reboot Time Warner. Now a division known as WarnerMedia, it will be turned into a streaming-video business — AT&T’s version of what has become the TV industry’s go-to strategy. Among its planned products: a service that combines HBO, Warner Bros. movies like “Wonder Woman” and shows like “Friends.”The Justice Department won’t appeal the decision. The court’s ruling was a blow to the department’s top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, who had hoped the case would strike a blow against so-called vertical mergers, which combine companies with complementary businesses.Where should Mr. Delrahim look now? Joe Nocera of Bloomberg Opinion argues that there are far larger consolidation problems in other industries, including tech and airlines.Many executives facing a contempt of court allegation from the Securities and Exchange Commission would stay quiet. Not Elon Musk.“Something is broken with S.E.C. oversight,” the Tesla C.E.O. tweeted yesterday. He was replying to a follower who complained about the contempt accusation moving Tesla’s stock.That will annoy S.E.C. officials, who worry that Mr. Musk isn’t taking their previous settlement with him seriously, according to the WSJ. Tesla lawyers conceded to the S.E.C. that they did not vet a tweet by Mr. Musk about production targets, though they helped write a subsequent “clarifying” tweet.The S.E.C. must try to punish Mr. Musk, some experts say. Officials “have to enforce this settlement,” Charles Elson of the University of Delaware told the FT. “If they let this go, then every C.E.O. will be saying they’re special.” But other lawyers think Mr. Musk’s actions underscore how toothless the S.E.C. is.All eyes will be on Michael Cohen at 10 a.m. Eastern today as he testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Mr. Cohen, once President Trump’s personal lawyer, has prepared testimony in which he’s expected to call his onetime boss a “con man” and a “cheat,” Nicholas Fandos and Maggie Haberman of the NYT report:• “Mr. Cohen is likely to lay out a picture of Mr. Trump that is fundamentally at odds with the take-charge, top-flight businessman persona he developed on the reality show ‘The Apprentice’ over the course of a decade.”• “Among the most explosive and potentially damning aspects of Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the oversight committee will be providing evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president, according to people familiar with the plans.” Some of that is tied to hush payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels.• Mr. Cohen is also expected to discuss the role of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s C.F.O., in those payments, as well as how long Mr. Trump continued to discuss plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow in 2016.• “He will also describe the president inflating or devaluing his net worth, referring to a financial statement of Mr. Trump’s that Mr. Cohen has in his possession, the people said.”• The scheduled testimony has already sparked some controversy, with Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and ally of the president, threatening to reveal what he said were Mr. Cohen’s extramarital affairs. Mr. Gaetz subsequently apologized.Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed that Parliament should have the option of seeking to delay Britain’s exit from the E.U., Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Her new plan offers lawmakers a vote on her Brexit deal by March 12. If that is rejected, a second vote by March 13 will let Parliament choose to leave the E.U. without a deal. If that is rejected, a vote will be held by March 14 that would allow lawmakers to request a “short, limited extension” to the process.“Mrs. May’s reversal was striking because she had insisted dozens of times in Parliament that Britain would definitely leave the European Union on schedule on March 29,” Mr. Castle writes. But it is “the latest in a long line of retreats as she has struggled to cajole the fractious Tories into supporting a revised version of the deal.”“While her move lessens significantly the risk of a potentially disastrous ‘no deal’ Brexit by the March 29 deadline, an extension of the negotiating period will merely delay that danger by a couple of months, not end it,” Mr. Castle adds.All 27 other E.U. governments would have to approve a postponement, and “unless Britain plans to hold a general election or another referendum, the delay is not likely to extend beyond early July, when a newly elected European Parliament is scheduled to meet.”More: The news reduces the significance of a series of parliamentary votes on a Brexit motion scheduled for later today. The pound is rebounding. And the E.U. has agreed on tough rules for London-based financial services companies operating on the Continent after Brexit.The Federal Trade Commission announced yesterday that it had a new team of officials to police tech giants.The task force will have 17 staff lawyers dedicated to “monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.”Tech “grows more important every day” in both the economy and daily life, the F.T.C.’s chairman, Joe Simons, said. “It makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”It’s not the F.T.C.’s first move against the tech giants. It was reported earlier this month to be considering a record multibillion-dollar fine for Facebook over privacy violations. And critics have increasingly called for breaking up big tech companies — especially the likes of Facebook, which controls Instagram and WhatsApp.The F.T.C. competition director sees “distinct challenges” for antitrust enforcement in tech. That director, Bruce Hoffman, is also quoted at the Verge as suggesting that some companies could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions.President Trump’s decision to cap a popular tax break will affect 11 million filers this year, Jim Tankersley of the NYT reports:• A $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes from federal income taxes, which was intended to reduce the cost of Mr. Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, will mean filers cannot deduct $323 billion on their 2018 federal returns.• “Many filers will benefit from different parts of the tax cuts, such as the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the reduction in marginal tax rates. Additionally, the law doubled the standard deduction that taxpayers may take, along with a host of other tax changes,” Mr. Tankersley writes.• “The so-called SALT cap is, however, most likely to affect the richest Americans: More than half of the tax increases from the change will fall on the top 1 percent of income earners, according to estimates by the independent Tax Policy Center in Washington.”Some of the biggest figures in finance and economics have conflicting takes.The Fed’s chairman, Jay Powell, told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that current economic conditions were “healthy” and their outlook “favorable.” But he added that there were “crosscurrents and conflicting signals,” which meant that financial conditions were “now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year.”Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is also wary. “We are prepared for a recession,” he said in the bank’s annual presentation to investors yesterday. “We’re not predicting a recession. We’re simply pointing out that we are very conscious about the risks we bear.”But Goldman Sachs is more sanguine. In a note published yesterday, economists at the firm argued that “some green shoots are emerging that suggest that sequential growth will pick up from here.” They believe the U.S. economy stands a good chance of picking up, and that China’s might, too.Deutsche Bank hired Robert Innocentin from Bank of America as a managing director for its financial sponsors team, part of its investment-banking business.Goldman Sachs has reportedly hired 100 employees to work in its nascent corporate cash management business, which aims to challenge Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.Deals• EBay is reportedly near a deal that would give the activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value seats on its board and prepare the online marketplace for a breakup.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersTOKYO/BENGALURU — Panasonic Corp and Tesla Inc will continue to make new investments in the U.S. electric carmaker's Gigafactory as needed, but believe they can squeeze more out of existing resources than previously planned, Tesla said on Thursday.Separately, Panasonic said it was watching the demand situation in the electric car market before making any further investments in expanding the capacity of the Nevada plant.The two companies were responding to a report by Japan's Nikkei that said they had frozen previous plans to raise the capacity of the plant, which supplies battery packs for Tesla cars.""Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory,"" a Tesla spokesperson said.""That said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated.""Giving no details of its sources, the Nikkei reported that financial issues had led the companies to rethink plans to expand the capacity of Gigafactory 1 by another 50 percent next year.The business daily said the companies had already together invested $4.5 billion in the facility and had been planning to expand the plant's capacity to the equivalent of 54 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year in 2020 from 35 GWh at present.The 35 GWh capacity can produce batteries for about 500,000 electric vehicles a year, a source familiar with Tesla's plans said, meaning that the previously planned expansion would have made the capacity enough for around 770,000 electric vehicles. ""Panasonic established a battery production capacity of 35 GWh in Tesla's Gigafactory 1 by the end of March 2019 in line with growing demand,"" Japan-based Panasonic said in an email. ""Watching the demand situation, Panasonic will study additional investments over 35 GWh in collaboration with Tesla.""Neither company had made public their detailed future development plans for the site, although Panasonic said in October it was in talks to add to its investment and take capacity over the 35 GWh. Tesla slid 2.8 percent on the Nasdaq Thursday, while Panasonic shares rose 2.6 percent in midday Tokyo trade Friday.""Panasonic shares have been dragged down by various Tesla woes,"" Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan. ""Turning cautious about further investments is good for Panasonic. It helps the company reduce the influence of Tesla."" Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, which in turn is Panasonic's biggest electric vehicle battery client. In February, Tesla said it had agreed to buy U.S. energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc, sending shares in Panasonic lower.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk also said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at its new Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.The Nikkei report said Panasonic would also suspend its planned investment in Tesla's new Shanghai plant and would instead provide technical support and a small number of batteries from the Gigafactory.The Japanese company said in October it would prioritize building additional capacity at the Gigafactory over China.Lower-than-expected car deliveries by Tesla in the first quarter spooked stock and bond investors earlier this month, adding to Wall Street's concerns about its future cashflow.Tesla is expected to report first-quarter earnings on April 24.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)President Trump has long enjoyed the backing of one major lender: Deutsche Bank. David Enrich of the NYT has taken a deep look into their often turbulent relationship — which is now under investigation by prosecutors and Congress.Deutsche Bank courted Mr. Trump when no one else would. He had already gone bankrupt, and no Wall Street lender would back him. But bankers at Deutsche like Mike Offit and Justin Kennedy (the son of Justice Anthony Kennedy) lent him millions. Mr. Trump rewarded some bankers, after some prompting, with a trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort.It issued loans despite finding financial discrepancies. Deutsche Bank officials concluded that Mr. Trump was worth about $788 million, not his self-proclaimed $3 billion. And a senior banking executive told Mr. Enrich that he had told others that Mr. Trump had worked with people in the construction industry who were tied to organized crime.Only when Mr. Trump sued Deutsche Bank did its investment banking arm drop him as a client. But its private wealth arm, hungry for business, eventually took him back and lent him millions more.After the 2016 election, Deutsche Bank executives admitted to problems. They concluded that their colleagues had ignored many warning signs about Mr. Trump, including from internal “exposure reports.” Salesmen for the firm were warned not to utter Mr. Trump’s name in public.Now the bank is in investigators’ cross hairs, and plans to hand over extensive internal documentation to Congress and federal prosecutors. Rosemary Vrablic, Mr. Trump’s main private banker — “She is the boss,” he once told the NYT — expects to be called to testify on Capitol Hill.After Elon Musk accused the S.E.C. of trying to trample on his constitutional rights, the regulator hit back yesterday, reiterating its case that the Tesla chief should be held in contempt of court, Bloomberg reports.The S.E.C. says he’s violating a court settlement under which it agreed not to charge him with securities fraud. He was supposed to have lawyers vet any Tesla-related tweets before he posts them; the S.E.C. said he hadn’t done so even once.Mr. Musk had argued that the S.E.C.’s objection was to one tweet, which mentioned previously undisclosed production forecasts. But the regulator said that the settlement was meant to cover a wide variety of his statements.“Such brazen disregard of this court’s order is unacceptable and unworkable going forward,” the S.E.C. said.A lawyer for Mr. Musk plans to respond in court by Friday. According to Bloomberg, the lawyer, John Hueston, said that the response “would include documents reflecting the negotiation history between Musk and the S.E.C., which he said would undermine the S.E.C.’s new assertions.”More officials are seeking answers from Boeing about an automated piloting feature that may have played a role in two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max 8 airplane.• House and Senate committees are preparing to question F.A.A. leaders next month about the Max jets, with a focus on the stall-prevention system, according to the WSJ.• Canada’s aviation regulator is reviewing its validation of the American certification of the 737 Max, Marc Garneau, the nation’s transport minister, told reporters yesterday.• They join officials from the Justice Department and the Transportation Department, who are studying the Max jet’s development process. The Transportation Department inspector general’s office is also investigating if the F.A.A. took shortcuts in the jet’s safety approval.Boeing’s C.E.O., Dennis Muilenburg, spoke out yesterday, making his first substantive public comments about the crash. “Our hearts are heavy, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board,” he said. He added that Boeing was “taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max.”More: If demand for Max jets falters, Airbus might struggle to build its rival offering, the A320neo, fast enough.The semiconductor industry is looking at an impending deal between the U.S. and China, and it doesn’t like what it sees — whether the talks succeed or fail.Chip-makers fear unintended consequences from one of Washington’s key demands, the WSJ reports, that Beijing promise more than $1 trillion in purchases of American goods and services over six years:• “China has offered to buy $30 billion of U.S. chips over six years, industry officials said, essentially doubling U.S. semiconductor exports to China.”• “For Beijing to guarantee the sales would require it to put together a kind of quota system, industry officials argued, and that mechanism could later be used to dole out contracts to Chinese firms.”But their investors have priced in extra orders from China. Shares in companies like Intel and AMD have jumped in value by as much as 20 percent so far this year as hopes of a trade deal with Beijing have risen. All that could go away if the talks break down.So what to do? Chip-makers have asked the Trump administration “not to include them” in any agreement over boosted trade quotas, according to the WSJ. (They have expressed support for other parts of the trade deal, including protection of intellectual property.)One of the biggest questions surrounding the National Enquirer’s exposé of Jeff Bezos’ affair with Lauren Sanchez was how it got the photos and text messages that it published. The answer, according to the WSJ: They came from Ms. Sanchez’s brother.• “Michael Sanchez, the brother of Mr. Bezos’ lover, sold the billionaire’s secrets for $200,000 to the Enquirer’s publisher, said people familiar with the matter.”• “Mr. Sanchez began conversations last fall with the tabloid about his sister’s relationship with Mr. Bezos, the people said. The Enquirer by then had already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.”• But David Pecker, the head of the National Enquirer’s parent company, was “concerned Mr. Bezos would sue, forcing debt-laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands.”• He was also advised that publishing the story might make the Enquirer look like it was doing the bidding of President Trump, who has publicly criticized Mr. Bezos.• Ultimately, of course, the story was published. But American Media’s financial backers, Chatham Asset Management, “conveyed their displeasure” about the fallout and “pressured Mr. Pecker to resolve the matter.”Kevin Tsujihara quit as the head of WarnerMedia’s Warner Bros. movie division yesterday, facing claims that he tried to further the career of an actress he had a sexual relationship with, Ed Lee of the NYT reports.Mr. Tsujihara is accused of helping Charlotte Kirk by putting her up for movie and TV parts. Rumors about his activities had swirled in Hollywood for a year, but were made public in a March 6 article in The Hollywood Reporter.He said that he decided to leave after talking with John Stankey, the head of WarnerMedia. But WarnerMedia said that the investigation would continue even after Mr. Tsujihara’s departure.It’s a black eye for WarnerMedia’s owner, AT&T. The telecom company considered the accusation before it promoted Mr. Tsujihara two weeks ago. Now it must fill his role while enduring a kind of scandal that it hasn’t experienced before. (Stacey Snider and Peter Chernin, both Hollywood veterans, may replace Mr. Tsujihara.)When the college admissions scandal news broke last week, it exposed how the SAT and ACT tests could be gamed. Bloomberg Businessweek spoke to Rebecca Kantar, the founder of a start-up called Imbellus, who thinks she knows how to shake things up.• Ms. Kantar says that standardized tests could be abused by the wealthy, through tutoring and fake scores, and give little insight about skills that will be useful in the future.• “The digital assessments Imbellus has developed resemble video games” that test decision-making, Romesh Ratnesar of Bloomberg writes. “Because each simulation delivers a unique user experience, they’re intended to be cheatproof.”• “We’re establishing that simulation-based assessments are a better medium for getting at deep-thinking skills than multiple-choice tests,” Ms. Kantar said.• So far, the company has raised $23.5 million in funding, and developed employee tests for McKinsey and Company and a few others.• “Kantar plans to begin giving the Imbellus test to high schoolers later this year,” Mr. Ratnesar writes. “She also says, without going into many details, that the company is bidding to take part in a federally funded national assessment that will test 100,000 students in 2022.”Fox News has hired Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic Party chairwoman, as a commentator.UBS hired Bob Casey from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and Robert Jackman from Outvest Capital as managing directors on its U.S. tech banking team.Goldman Sachs is aiming to have half of its junior banker hires in the U.S. be women.Deals• The European Central Bank’s top regulator said he didn’t approve of national champions, which could complicate a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Jack EwingGeneva — After years of promising electric cars, established carmakers are actually starting to build them.But manufacturers are realizing that a shift to battery power also requires them to retool their sales machinery. The old come-ons are obsolete. Range is the new horsepower. Connectivity replaces cylinder count. And sustainability is the new status symbol. Volvo’s Polestar 2 electric car, unveiled last week, even comes with a leather-free “vegan” interior.The need for carmakers to win over a public still hesitant about buying a car that needs half an hour or more to recharge is becoming more urgent as electric vehicles move closer to mass production.Battery-powered rides like the BMW i3, Nissan Leaf and Tesla’s lineup have been available for years. But this once-niche category is now expanding at a breakneck pace.There are dozens of new electric cars on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, which opened to the public on Thursday and continues through March 17. These are not concept cars that may never be for sale, as tended to be the case at previous shows. They are vehicles with familiar brand names that you will be able to buy this year or next.An electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year. Volkswagen is refitting a German factory to build a battery-powered car that, beginning in 2020, will sell for about the same price as a Golf.Audi, a unit of Volkswagen, showed nothing but battery-powered vehicles and hybrids at the Geneva show. Renault, one of the first companies to offer electric cars, is renewing its lineup. Volvo skipped the show in order to leave the stage to its all-electric Polestar.“2019 will be a decisive year for electromobility,” Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief executive, said at a company event in Geneva.It’s also a moment of truth for the traditional automakers, which have long argued that their decades of experience in manufacturing will allow them to avoid the start-up problems suffered by Tesla and to dominate the next wave of automotive technology.Tesla’s financial woes, which have prompted it to shutter retail stores and lay off 7 percent of its work force, may prove them right. But it remains to be seen whether the entrenched carmakers can generate the same energized fan base.The key to selling any product is differentiation, making your car seem cooler and more capable than all the others. Long ago, it was V-8 engines, six-speed automatic transmissions, and the actor Ricardo Montalbán caressing the “soft Corinthian leather” seats of a Chrysler Cordoba.But a lot of the features that set conventional cars apart, like fast acceleration, quiet interiors and smooth handling, are pretty much standard with electric cars.While gasoline engines need at least a few seconds to gather momentum, batteries deliver instant pep. Electric motors make very little noise. And battery packs, heavy and usually spread out beneath the passenger compartment, provide a low center of gravity and help glue an electric car to the road.Automakers also need to prevent their models from becoming commodities as the whole idea of car ownership is under attack by Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies.One way Volvo and others are trying to answer the upstarts is by importing a bit of Silicon Valley vibe, even if their engineers are in Sweden or Stuttgart. Polestar, which is positioning itself as a brand separate from Volvo, staged the recent unveiling of the Polestar 2 as if it were a new iteration of the iPhone.Thomas Ingenlath, the chief executive of Polestar, bounded onto a stage in Gothenburg, Sweden, wearing a mustard-colored zip-up jacket over black slacks and a T-shirt and white sneakers.Polestar is “redefining premium for the electric age,” Mr. Ingenlath said, standing in front of a giant video screen. His presentation, broadcast online, was heavy on the car’s digital features, including an 11-inch touch screen and Google voice recognition software that allows drivers to summon driving directions or call up a tune from Spotify.A United States version of the Polestar 2 will go on sale early next year, initially in California and Washington State, for about $63,000. (The Polestar 1, a performance hybrid, has just begun rolling off a Chinese production line.) Dealerships will be small retail spaces in city downtowns, and some may be pop-up stores.When Mr. Ingenlath got to the part about the Polestar 2’s vegan interior, he showed an image of cows looking content, presumably because they were not fated to become car seats. “I will spare you now the video of mass production of leather,” Mr. Ingenlath said, somewhat darkly.Ricardo Montalbán, who died in 2009, may not have been a fan, but the pitch underlined the carmakers’ assumption that electric car buyers will skew green.The primary motivation of a customer who wants an electric vehicle “is being friendly to the planet,” Olivier Murguet, executive vice president for sales at French carmaker Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.But, he added, electric vehicle customers pay close attention to the same things as other car buyers, like the purchase price.Electric cars continue to cost thousands of dollars more than conventional vehicles. High price remains an obstacle, mostly because of the cost of the batteries. That may be less of a problem than it seems. Electric vehicles already on the road are holding on to their value well, Mr. Murguet said. That allows carmakers to offer attractive leasing terms because they know the cars will command a good resale price when the lease expires.European customers can lease a Renault Zoe, a two-door battery-powered subcompact, for 150 euros a month, or $170. “Even if the price of the cars is higher, the amount to finance from a customer’s perspective is not that much more,” Gilles Normand, senior vice president for electric vehicles at Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.And many buyers of electric cars won’t be individuals, but car-sharing services that buy them by the dozens and can spread the cost among more users. Those buyers tend to pay attention to the cost of a car over its life span rather than just the initial purchase price. Electric cars look better from that angle because they don’t require oil changes and electricity is cheaper per mile than gasoline.“The whole business case is changing for all of us,” Chris Delaney, president of Europe for tire maker Goodyear, said as he sat in a self-driving electric shuttle van on display in Geneva. (Goodyear is supplying specialized tires for the vehicle.)While electric vehicles account for only about 5 percent of Goodyear’s current sales, Mr. Delaney said, they account for 40 percent of new business from manufacturers — an indication of how fast demand is rising. Electric cars pose a design challenge for tiremakers as well. The cars’ high weight and fast acceleration require a more robust tire.The open question is whether any of the established carmakers, who still make most of their money from conventional vehicles, can generate buzz as effectively as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. Despite all of Tesla’s problems, Mr. Musk commands widespread respect in the industry for transforming the image of electric cars from nerdy science projects to desirable performance vehicles.So far, no other car manager has demonstrated Mr. Musk’s ability to make Tesla the center of the conversation, though not always in a good way.“Tesla did a lot to build up the market for electric cars,” Detlev von Platen, head of sales and marketing at Porsche, said. “We have a lot of respect for what they accomplished. They’re a reference for us.”Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Green, chief executive of the ride-hailing service Lyft, was asked which tech leaders he admired, he pointed to three men who had built their companies ruthlessly: Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.“A lot of other Silicon Valley companies are very scared to get their hands dirty with operations,” Mr. Green said in a 2017 interview with The New York Times, adding that he wanted to emulate the take-no-prisoners methods of Mr. Musk, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Bezos.The problem for Mr. Green is that Lyft seems very nice. Its app is pink. Its cars were once adorned with fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches. Its drivers have a reputation for being friendly. And while Lyft has racked up more than one billion rides and become a strong No. 2 to Uber in the United States and Canada, it has not shaken off its cuddly image.Now Mr. Green, 35, must show that Lyft can be as assertive as an Amazon or a Facebook. He and Uber are locked in a race to take their companies public: Both filed papers in December to list on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings — the first for any ride-hailing firm — are likely to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley and set the stage for listings of other highly valued tech start-ups, including Slack and Pinterest.The pressure is on Mr. Green to get the jump on Uber. (Both offerings have been stalled because the government shutdown, which ended Friday, prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from reviewing their filings.) Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.For Mr. Green, this means he may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role. While Lyft’s more gregarious president, John Zimmer, his No. 2 for the last 12 years, has frequently handled the public-facing side of the business, Mr. Green would rather speak at staff meetings than at tech conferences. Colleagues describe him as reserved.In a 2017 interview, Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Green was often misunderstood because of his quiet demeanor. “He is, like, extremely competitive,” Mr. Zimmer, now 34, said. “He has been an activist.”Lyft declined to make Mr. Green or Mr. Zimmer available for new interviews, citing the quiet period before an initial public offering. In a statement, the chief operating officer, Jon McNeill, described them as “cutthroat missionaries in service of creating positive change.”One of the tech leaders Mr. Green cited as inspiration, Mr. Musk, recommended against taking Lyft public.“The current system makes long-term value creation and product innovation difficult,” Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla, wrote in an email last week. “It insists on quarter-by-quarter results or punishes companies severely. This is particularly bad for companies that are high growth and are valued on potential, like Lyft (or Tesla).” (The S.E.C. fined Mr. Musk  last year for a tweet about taking Tesla private.)Mr. Green, who was born and raised in Culver City, Calif., graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2006 with a degree in business economics. He then worked as the university’s sustainability coordinator, poring over alternatives to the gas-guzzling one-car-per-owner model. He was also on the board of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, a position that gave him insight into municipal transportation.While visiting Zimbabwe on vacation during his 20s, Mr. Green said in the 2017 interview, he was inspired by Zimbabweans who had created makeshift services to fill every seat in car pools, saving passengers money and taking cars off the road.So in 2007, Mr. Green started Zimride in Santa Barbara, Calif., to provide long-distance car-pool rides to college students by matching them with other students who were driving.Mr. Zimmer, then working at Lehman Brothers, noticed posts about the start-up on Facebook from John Siegel, whom he had met while studying abroad and who had attended middle school with Mr. Green.“John didn’t have this technical or programming background, but he was this really impressive guy,” Mr. Siegel said. “I thought they could work together well.”Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who remained in New York, embarked on what Mr. Zimmer called a “long-distance relationship,” working together over Skype. In 2008, they moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto, Calif. Neither drew a salary in the first three years of building Zimride, and each contract they sold to a college was celebrated with a trip to Ikea for Swedish meatballs, Mr. Zimmer said.In 2011, Zimride raised $6 million. But as a web service, it was caught flat-footed by the rise of smartphones and mobile apps. In 2012, Mr. Green decided to spin out of Zimride a mobile, peer-to-peer ride-hailing service, calling it Lyft.Instead of just pairing students for long-distance rides, Lyft would put drivers together with riders on public streets, in real time. Mr. Zimmer came up with the idea to emblazon the cars with pink mustaches; Mr. Green encouraged passengers to greet their drivers with a fist bump, to keep the community feeling of Zimride.At the time, ride-hailing wasn’t legal, and only licensed drivers could pick up passengers on public streets. Ann Miura-Ko, a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate, who had invested in Zimride and sits on Lyft’s board, recalled that some board members had been doubtful about the change — but that Mr. Green had been confident.“Someone asked, ‘Will this really work?’ And he wasn’t just sure, he was positive,” she said.But Mr. Green didn’t reckon with one issue: Uber. At the time, Uber, run by Travis Kalanick, had positioned itself as a luxury service for the wealthy that used only licensed drivers, unlike Lyft’s lower-cost service. In 2013, Uber published a white paper outlining the risks of peer-to-peer ride-hailing, a way to elbow Lyft out of the market.“They were trying to get the whole category shut down behind the scenes,” Mr. Green said. “They didn’t want competition.”Uber officials met with California regulators about the matter. As for Mr. Green, several current and former regulators and lawmakers who oversee ride-sharing in California said they had never worked with him, because Mr. Zimmer was often the one who communicated with officials.“Truth be told, I’ve never heard of him,” said Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor who called for crackdowns on Uber and Lyft in their early years and negotiated a new per-ride tax with Uber and Lyft last summer.Mr. Kalanick eventually moved Uber into non-luxury ride-sharing with no licensed drivers, the same as Lyft. He and Mr. Green quickly became bitter rivals. When Mr. Green was set to introduce Lyft’s car-pooling product in 2014, Uber announced the same service first.That same year, Uber considered buying Lyft. Over dinner at Mr. Kalanick’s home in San Francisco, the Uber chief laughed at Mr. Zimmer’s high asking price. No deal was struck.An Uber spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick didn’t return a request for comment.While Mr. Kalanick went on to raise billions of dollars in funding for Uber, Mr. Green relied on Mr. Zimmer’s Wall Street knowledge and showman personality to garner investments from venture capitalists and others. In total, Lyft has raised close to $5.1 billion, compared with Uber’s roughly $14 billion in equity.In 2017, Mr. Kalanick was ousted from Uber after a series of scandals. Mr. Green seized the moment, billing Lyft as a kinder, gentler network. Ridership surged, with Lyft taking a share of up to 35 percent in some American cities.More recently, Lyft has ventured into self-driving cars, offering autonomous rides in Las Vegas. It also acquired Motivate, the largest bike-share operator in the United States, giving Lyft a dominant position in an emerging transportation market.In the 2017 interview, Mr. Green said he was far from done.“As an entrepreneur, you always kind of want what you’re pitching to sound somewhat off the wall,” he said. “You’re trying to pitch the future that doesn’t exist, and you want it to be — it needs to be — a little bit of a stretch.”Follow Mike Isaac and Kate Conger on Twitter: @mikeisaac and @kateconger.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byMounting delays to the Space Launch System, primarily built by Boeing, are leading the agency to consider alternative forms of transport.By Kenneth ChangStruggling to get its new giant rocket ready in time for a scheduled launch next year, NASA might just leave it on the ground and turn to commercial alternatives.“NASA has a history of not meeting launch dates,” said Jim Bridenstine, NASA’s administrator, at a Senate committee hearing on Wednesday, “and I’m trying to change that.”NASA plans to send its Orion capsule, designed to carry astronauts on deep space missions, on a crewless test trip around the moon next year. But the schedule for completing the rocket that is to carry Orion — known as the Space Launch System — has slipped repeatedly despite NASA’s spending more than $10 billion on the program so far. Last year, in announcing the latest delay, NASA said that the mission was penciled in for the end of 2019 but even then conceded that June 2020 was a more realistic target date.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]In October, NASA’s inspector general issued a report that was sharply critical of Boeing, the rocket’s prime contractor. “Cost increases and schedule delays of core stage development can be traced largely to management, technical, and infrastructure issues driven by Boeing’s poor performance,” the report said. “For example, Boeing officials have consistently underestimated the scope of the work to be performed and thus the size and skills of the work force required.”On Wednesday, Mr. Bridenstine said that last week it had become clear that the rocket would probably not be ready even by June 2020. He said he had directed managers to explore whether there would be another way to launch.“The goal is to get back on track,” Mr. Bridenstine said. He said the space agency would make a decision “in the next couple of weeks,” and that it might require additional money from Congress.The largest rockets currently built by private companies are smaller than the Space Launch System, so if NASA decides on this approach, the payload for the mission would need to be split between two rockets. The Orion capsule and its service module, a component built by the European Space Agency to provide power and propulsion, would ride to orbit on one rocket. A fueled rocket stage for propelling Orion to the moon would go up separately. The two pieces would then rendezvous and dock in orbit before heading to the moon. Mr. Bridenstine noted that Orion currently lacks the ability to dock with another spacecraft in orbit. “Between now and June of 2020, we would have to make that a reality,” Mr. Bridenstine said. Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi and chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, noted: “This is 2019.” A commercially launched mission would allow extended testing of Orion and the service module, one of the main goals, but it would push the first flight of the Space Launch System further into the future.Mr. Bridenstine did not name which commercial rockets might be used, but the two that are powerful enough are the Delta 4 Heavy from the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and the Falcon Heavy from SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Elon Musk.The Orion has been launched once already on top of a Delta 4 Heavy, in 2014, for a crewless test flight, but that did not go to the moon. The Falcon Heavy has only flown on its February 2018 test launch.At the hearing, Mr. Bridenstine continued to describe the big NASA rocket as a core component of the space agency’s plans. But if the commercial approach works for the test flight, some space watchers wonder why the same strategy would not work for missions carrying astronauts.NASA may move away from the Space Launch System and use less expensive commercial rockets for other missions as well, including for pieces of the Lunar Gateway, a planned outpost in orbit around the moon, and the launching of the Europa Clipper, a robotic mission to study one of Jupiter’s moons.In its budget proposal for fiscal year 2020, the Trump administration is also proposing the delay of an upgrade to the second stage of the Space Launch System that Boeing is working on. That is not needed for the early missions but will enable the transport of heavier payloads to space.Kenneth Chang has been at The Times since 2000, writing about physics, geology, chemistry, and the planets.

" AdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Jamie CondliffeHi. I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news.There is little as fashionable in 2019 as the desire to curb Big Tech’s power. But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valley’s largest companies isn’t straightforward.At one extreme, there are calls to break up Big Tech.  Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, argued that companies shouldn’t offer their own products on platforms they controlled (like Apple’s selling apps on its App Store — something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday). She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions, such as Facebook’s takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp.Her pitch isn’t perfect, as The New York Times’s Kevin Roose pointed out — it’s too generic, misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues. But it is a bold, inspiring rally cry for Big Tech’s biggest critics.At the other end of the spectrum: tech companies. Ideally, the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly. But even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, acknowledged that it was “inevitable that there will be some regulation” when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in April.There’s plenty of room between those extremes. Take, for example, a report published Wednesday by the British government, which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech. Its main proposal: that a new regulator identify companies with “strategic market status,” then block some activities — such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors (hello, Google!).That, the report’s authors say, is a “more pro-business and pro-consumer solution” than “changing antitrust law to drive breakup” of businesses.So who’s right? Mr. Zuckerberg, at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable. There’s strong bipartisan support for such regulation. As for where a line should be drawn, that’s harder to say.Breaking up big companies isn’t easy: It’s expensive and takes a long time. And it doesn’t always go to plan. The last notable attempt to do so, when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law, was overturned on appeal. So Ms. Warren could have her work cut out for her.But it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need. Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies, or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior? That’s something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle with.When OpenAI was founded three years ago, it had a huge goal: to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain. Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions — it had $1 billion in funding from backers to pay its way — the public could trust it to build that so-called general artificial intelligence.Only, $1 billion doesn’t go far with goals like that. Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash. Actually, it turns out, some profits might be useful.So, Wired reported, Open AI announced that it was changing its business model. To keep up with Facebook and Google, it created a OpenAI L.P., a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit, like venture funds. That will make it easier to raise funds. Down the line, it might monetize some of the technology it develops. But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see — to $100 for every dollar invested.One way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a 100-times return to be an ethical margin on building a general A.I. — enough to make it a feasible endeavor, but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush. That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley. But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at ease.On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss, Mike Sendall, called “vague but exciting.” It ultimately became the World Wide Web, and 30 years later we’re left with much to love — and hate — about its existence.At an event at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the web’s passage into its fourth decade, Mr. Berners-Lee was asked what it might look like in another 30 years. Here’s what he said:■ “It’s not, I think, for us to try and guess.”■ “Look at what’s happened over the last 30 years. The web has changed really dramatically, and a lot of that we couldn’t have predicted.”■ “What we can do is we can say what web we want.”■ “We want a web which is open. We want a web which is royalty-free. We want a web which is discrimination-free.”Worthy goals. And in an article he wrote this past week, Mr. Berners-Lee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen:■ “Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open.”■ “Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety.”■ “Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. “■ “And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable.”Thirty years on, Mr. Sendall’s analysis might apply equally well to this proposal, too.Elon Musk really dislikes whistle-blowers. According to Businessweek, Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the company.How does Google pay off executives accused of misconduct? Handsomely: Two shared a total of $135 million, according to details that emerged from a lawsuit during the week.Who will fund the next wave of tech start-ups? That’ll be the millionaires who are created when companies like Airbnb and Uber go public.You should care about TikTok. You might never use it, but it could reshape social media as you know it.Scientists dropped a smartphone into a blender. Because that, apparently, is the best way to work out how much cobalt, gold and other substances are in there.How to disappear (almost) completely: A Bitcoin evangelist offered 15 steps to going dark while staying online.Silicon Valley wants to build a monument.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Lela MooreIt’s embarrassing to err so publicly, and having to correct any of our journalism is regrettable. But some of the corrections we ran in 2018 not only set the record straight. They also did so while affording our readers the pleasure of schadenfreude at our expense. Now that we have closed out 2018, here’s a look back at seven of our most surprising — and comical — corrections of the year.This one rendered one Times editor and lots of readers nearly speechless on Twitter. Oh  https://t.co/AzIzqy9Fz3 pic.twitter.com/fiKM7SxmEzIt corrected the already startling Science article “Why Are Some Crows Committing Acts of Necrophilia?”What about the time we forgot to remove our “Millennials to Snake People” browser extension before cutting and pasting? Don’t you hate it when that happens?No one sets out to write an article that requires a formal correction. Unfortunately, mistakes happen. We published more than 4,100 corrections on digital articles in 2018. We estimate that hundreds more ran on videos, podcasts and graphics features. Other corrections were published only in print.For perspective: The Times published more than 55,000 articles in 2018, and more than 50 million words.Many of our mistakes are typos that don’t require formal corrections. We mixed metaphors and wrote of rankled feathers when we meant ruffled ones. We talked of honing in on issues when we meant homing in. (Phil Corbett, our associate managing editor for standards, has the best advice for avoiding this one: “Think pigeons, not knives.”) Errors like these are remedied as quickly as possible, usually without a formal correction appended.But factual errors necessitate a formal fix, and it is these corrections to which our readers point as a barometer of our transparency and our willingness to admit our mistakes. Here, for example, we corrected our error on a tweet about Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder and chief executive.In an article about Vespas not depreciating in value, we ran a photo misidentifying the scooters. Oops. In a Cooking article about salmon with harissa, we misstated one of the main ingredients of the spicy sauce. A New York Times correction follows a distinct pattern: First we tell you the type of error we committed. Then we state the fact — minus the inaccuracy — as clearly as possible.Sometimes numbers get the best of us. Here we wildly understated the odds of winning the Powerball. Sometimes we type too fast and end up saying something completely different than we intended. Rage, wage — what a difference a letter makes!Our New Year’s resolution is to keep delivering great journalism. Here’s hoping we make fewer errors in the process. Rogene Jacquette contributed reporting. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the error we made in calculating the odds of winning the Powerball. We understated — not overstated — them. The article also misstated Phil Corbett’s title. He is the associate managing editor for standards, not the assistant managing editor for standards.

" AdvertisementSupported bywith interestPlus, the latest news on Boeing’s plane troubles, and more Brexit angst.By Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox? Sign up here.Here’s your roundup of the top news in business and tech, plus all you need to know for the week ahead. Even if your March Madness bracket was a flop, at least you can feel good about your news I.Q.MARCH 31-APRIL 6Boeing’s grounded fleet of 737 Max jets probably won’t be back in the air anytime soon. A preliminary report on what caused one of the aircraft to crash in Ethiopia last month determined that the pilots followed all of Boeing’s safety protocols. While investigators stopped short of blaming the company for the plane crash, the report does put more pressure on the manufacturer and aviation authorities to figure out what happened — and to make sure it won’t again. Boeing has already lost one order of its 737 planes from Indonesia’s national airline, and the longer it takes to get the jets cleared for flight, the more customers (and money) it stands to lose. President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to give Mexico a “one-year warning” to stop drug smuggling and illegal immigration or he’ll close the southern border. This was a big step back from a threat he had made the week before, when he said he’d close the border in the next few days. His initial statement was followed by widespread panic. A border closing would seriously harm the American economy, halting the daily flow of $1.7 billion of goods and services between the two countries. This would cause food shortages (where would we get our avocados?) and price spikes. It would also hurt the 500,000 legal workers, students, shoppers and tourists who cross the border each day. If you’re getting tired of Facebook’s user data — particularly your own — showing up in places it shouldn’t, you’re in good company. A cybersecurity firm reported this past week that it had stumbled upon a huge cache of Facebook user information on one of Amazon’s cloud computing servers. The information included millions of Facebook users’ passwords, comments, and account names, and all of it could be downloaded by anyone who found it online. The database was closed after Facebook learned about its contents, but considering the rash of similar cases in the past year, this won’t be the last breach of its kind. APRIL 7-13Mr. Trump escalated his sniping at the Federal Reserve on Friday, calling on the organization to cut interest rates and use other means to boost economic growth. He also continued to accuse the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, of throwing water on the economy by raising interest rates last year. It’s unusual for a president to so openly attempt to exert influence over the central bank, but Mr. Trump is taking his efforts a step further by announcing plans to nominate two of his longtime supporters for seats on the Fed’s board. One is his “friend,” the former pizza executive and 2012 presidential hopeful Herman Cain, and the other is Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Powell will surely be asked about all of this on Wednesday, after the Fed releases the minutes of its March meeting. European Union leaders will hold a last-minute summit on Wednesday to discuss the fate of Brexit, which has now dragged on past the point of absurdity. Britain is now slated to withdraw from the bloc on April 12 with or without a concrete plan, unless Prime Minister Theresa May can win Parliament’s agreement for another deadline extension. There has been much hand-wringing over the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which could be disastrous for the British economy as well as its trade partners. To prepare, many businesses have staged their own reverse Brexit, moving operations elsewhere and holding off on investing in British companies. It’s a lose-lose for Britain, and prolonging the process isn’t likely to improve matters. A trade deal with China may finally be nigh. But then again, who really knows? On Thursday, Mr. Trump gathered with the Chinese delegation, which was in Washington for the umpteenth round of negotiations, to say that he’s anticipating an “epic” trade agreement in about four weeks. He was also expected to announce a presidential summit with Xi Jinping of China, presumably to sign that deal, but he stopped short of doing so. “If we have a deal, then we’ll have a summit,” Mr. Trump said. He is under mounting pressure to make good on the lofty promises he made to American businesses about an agreement, but the clock is ticking on the economic damage that trade tensions are wreaking around the world. Jeff and Mackenzie Bezos have finalized the details of their divorce. He will keep 75 percent of their joint shares in Amazon, leaving her with a $36 billion stake — which makes her one of the richest women in the world. Speaking of wealthy people, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, is still battling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his ill-advised (and unadvised) tweets about his company. A New York judge gave both parties two weeks to sort out their differences, and recommended that they put on their “reasonableness pants” to do so — a tall order, in this case.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(If you don’t get California Today by email, here’s the sign-up.)Yesterday, my colleagues Thomas Fuller, Jennifer Medina and Conor Dougherty took a hard look at the future of America’s  infrastructure projects, like California’s high-speed rail. More specifically: Are projects that big even possible anymore, given the cost and regulation? In California, that regulation has reached notoriously byzantine heights and is epitomized in four letters: C.E.Q.A. Conor explains how that happened:The rapidly escalating cost of California’s high-speed rail project has led to a loss of political support and cast a cloud over its prospects, raising big questions about America’s ability to take on big projects as it once did. The train’s problems also highlight a paradox here and across the nation: It’s often hardest to build in the populated areas where investment is needed most.For those trying to carry out such projects in California, nothing is more daunting than the California Environmental Quality Act, or C.E.Q.A. Signed by Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1970, the statute has become a widely used legal tool for delaying or stopping public-works projects from the massive to the micro — even, until recently, those designating bike lanes. And those cases can pit environmental objections against environmental goals.It is widely agreed in California that new housing and infrastructure should be built in and around population centers, to curb sprawl, to cut down on driving, and to help the state meet its ambitious goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But lawsuits filed under the environmental quality act have often taken aim at just such projects.According to a 2015 study, about 80 percent of the environmental lawsuits filed in California over a three-year period were targeted at “infill” developments in already populated areas. Housing and infrastructure projects accounted for more than half. The complaints can be brought on any number of environmental grounds, like the dust and noise generated or the impact on views.Several years ago a proposal to add passenger trains to a cargo rail line already in use was challenged on the grounds that it would lead to additional squealing and grease drippage. In the case of the high-speed rail project, designed to link the Central Valley with the Bay Area and Los Angeles, a C.E.Q.A. lawsuit by the Silicon Valley enclave of Atherton challenged whether the rail authority had adequately studied the engineering of the train’s route.That case ultimately failed, but even fighting litigation adds to a project’s cost and can often delay it. The rail project has been challenged on other legal grounds as well, including its adherence to the terms of a bond issue financing it.Increased investment in roads, bridges and power plants has won support across party lines. But as California’s experience illustrates, talk about big projects is easy. Routing them around legal land mines is hard.(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Sign up here.)The special counsel, Robert Mueller, did not find evidence that President Trump coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr said yesterday. But the White House still faces legal challenges.Mr. Trump claimed victory from the report, which concluded Mr. Mueller’s two-year investigation into the Russia issue. Especially comforting to the president: Mr. Mueller did not recommend additional indictments of his inner circle.The president was not found to have obstructed justice, Mr. Barr added, saying that the special counsel did not find enough evidence. But the report did not exonerate Mr. Trump on this accusation, as Mr. Mueller did not provide a verdict either way.Mr. Trump derided the inquiry as an “illegal takedown that failed,” and demanded that those responsible for it face additional scrutiny. That triumphalism ran counter to advice from aides.But the White House isn’t in the clear yet. Congressional Democrats pledged to continue pursuing investigations into Trump and his allies. And prosecutors in New York City are still investigating an array of issues that touch on Mr. Trump’s business and political dealings.The markets may get a small boost from the end of the investigation, according to analysts who spoke to CNBC.China’s top economic policymakers have promised more market-based competition and international trade, in the latest sign that the country is eager to end its trade war with the U.S., Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes.The promises being made were significant. Officials at the China Development Forum, the country’s premier annual economic policy conference, spoke of increasing imports, a desire for more foreign investment and a willingness to allow foreign financial firms to own larger stakes in their Chinese competitors.They may sound familiar, however. “Chinese officials have said for years that they were ready to allow foreign competitors to enter their market on a more equal footing,” Mr. Bradsher writes. “The promises made over the weekend in many cases repeated pledges that have been made before.”But China now has other reasons to embrace openness. “In addition to a trade war that is hitting the country’s exporters, China’s economy has also been hurt by private sector business leaders who have become increasingly cautious in recent months about making new investments,” Mr. Bradsher adds.The promises will most likely feature in trade talks. American and Chinese officials are scheduled to hold trade talks in Beijing in the coming days, and another round of talks in Washington the following week.The airplane maker is taking more steps to convince the authorities and customers that fixes for its 737 Max 8 jets — two of which have crashed in recent months — are near.It tested a software update  for the Max 8 aircraft with pilots from five airlines over the weekend, the NYT reports. Using flight simulators, the pilots were able to safely land planes suffering from problems believed to have brought down Lion Air Flight 610 last year.And the company outlined other software fixes that are meant to eliminate flaws in an automated piloting program at the heart of the crashes. Boeing also said that it would now make two previously optional safety features on the planes free of charge.But Boeing is facing heat from Congress over the safety-certification process that cleared the Max 8 for flight. Lawmakers are concerned about how much responsibility the company held for certifying the safety of its own planes.More Boeing news: How the company rushed to roll out the 737 Max to catch up with Airbus. Why the crashes highlight the challenges of adding modern software to older technology. And why JPMorgan Chase economists worry about broader fallout from Boeing’s problems.The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Since 1960, every time that it has inverted — when long-term rates were lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed.It happened on Friday.More on that from Matt Phillips of the NYT:• “The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled to 2.44 percent Friday, its lowest level since January 2018. That was just below the 2.45 percent yield on three-month Treasury bills.”• “Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has cited the yield difference between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes — which inverted Friday — as the most reliable predictor of recession risk.”• “On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent, as stock market investors grew concerned about the outlook for economic growth. It was the second-worst drop for the market this year.”Don’t hyperventilate. Some parts of the yield curve have not yet inverted, and experts say the inversion doesn’t necessarily predict economic collapse. “A model is just a model,” Campbell Harvey, a Duke University finance professor, told the NYT. “It’s not an oracle. It helps us forecast the future, but it might at any point fail.”With smartphone sales stagnating, Apple is making a push to make money from services. And today, we find out what that looks like, as the company makes a series of announcements about its moves into the world of media. Here’s what to expect:• Video streaming. According to the WSJ, Apple has “used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit,” and plans to announce tie-ups to offer $9.99 subscriptions for channels like HBO and Showtime. Original content would reportedly “be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer,” and also require a subscription.• News. The company’s new news-subscription service is expected to cost $9.99 a month and provide “access to more than 200 magazines — including Bon Appétit, People and Glamour — as well as newspapers,” according to the WSJ.• And maybe games? Bloomberg suggests that the company might even announce “a premium games subscription for its App Store.” This wouldn’t be the cloud gaming of the kind announced by Google last week, but bundles of games for the iPhone and iPad.You can watch the event here, starting at 1 p.m. Eastern.The British prime minister is struggling for control and respect as she tries again to gain Parliament’s support for her Brexit deal this week.Her week starts with a tense cabinet meeting, with her Conservative Party in “uproar after ministers discussed replacing her as leader just weeks before the Brexit deadline,” according to the FT.Lawmakers will then try to undermine her control of Brexit, when they vote later today on a plan “to take control of the legislative agenda for a single day,” Bloomberg explains. “This would allow lawmakers to express support for different options ranging from a second referendum to a customs union with the E.U. and even canceling Brexit.”She’s still hawking her Brexit deal. But meetings over the weekend with high-profile Euroskeptic lawmakers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to gain their backing. That means she still lacks the support needed to win a third vote on her proposal.All this comes against the backdrop of public demand for a second referendum on Brexit. On Saturday, an estimated 1 million people marched through London to demand a new vote on leaving the E.U.As the S.E.C. and Elon Musk continue to fight in court over his tweeting, the Tesla C.E.O. fired back on Friday. His latest argument: the agency is incorrectly interpreting a settlement agreement between the two.Mr. Musk’s insists his tweet review process is O.K. In his view, he is supposed to only run tweets containing material information about Tesla by an in-house lawyer — and he is free to determine what qualifies. An earlier draft of the settlement, offered by the S.E.C., would have required him to run all public statements by a lawyer. He rejected that proposal.He also says the tweet that drew the ire of the S.E.C. wasn’t controversial. His comment about Tesla production forecasts, he argues, contained information that had previously been made public, and was made after stock markets closed for the day. But the S.E.C. says that’s an after-the-fact rationalization.It’s up to a judge to decide whether Mr. Musk violated the settlement and should be held in contempt.

" AdvertisementSupported byThe shift away from private vehicles will happen faster than we think. By Kara SwisherMs. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. I will die before I buy another car.I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend.Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?Finished. [Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think.Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought.I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank.Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon.Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized.That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all.It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not.Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Alyson Krueger[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The Explorers Club is exactly what it sounds like: a members-only institution, established more than a century ago, and dedicated to scientific inquiry. Many of those admitted — there are currently 3,500 members — have touched upon uncharted territories, and all are active in the field of science research. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were part of the club, as was Thor Heyerdahl. Recently, Elon Musk joined.For 115 years, members have gathered annually for a weekend of science and a black-tie dinner at the New York headquarters, on the Upper East Side. The most recent event, held on March 16, featured 10 astronauts who were part of the Apollo program and an auction where attendees could bid on joining a world-renowned paleontologist on a dinosaur fossil dig.The weekend of science also introduced something new: The club let its youngest members, some still undergraduates in college, present their initiatives.There was Alex Borowicz, a Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University, who uses high-resolution satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to track whales. “It used to be that people had to go on a boat with binoculars to do that,” he said, during his presentation. “I do it from my couch.”Another young presenter was Stephen Daire, a graduate student at the University of Southern California. He had built robots able to explore caves so humans don’t have to. His robot even builds itself a charging station before it starts its work so it can take care of its own needs later.For generations, exploration meant going to faraway lands and bringing back significant artifacts. The club is filled with items from these journeys: tusks from a rare elephant species and flags that flew on the moon. A giant taxidermy polar bear hovers over the second floor.But it is clear that the newer members are different kinds of pioneers. Many of them are using technology, in addition to safari gear and compasses, to uncover the world’s greatest secrets. This has resulted in some growing pains at the club, as younger and older members struggle to expand the definition of exploration in 2019.“For the older folks, maybe they were the first person somewhere because the world hadn’t been explored that much, and they had that opportunity,” said Aleksandr Rikhterman, 26, a Brooklyn-based documentary filmmaker. “We can’t do that so we have to look at exploring differently. We can use new tools to take a closer look at the environments that have already been found.”The afternoon of presentations showcasing new technologies was the first step.To join the club with full voting rights, two other members must nominate you, and annual fees can cost hundreds of dollars. But there is also a way to as a join as a student member, for which the initiation fee is waived, with just one referral.That said, being a young member in the Explorers Club can sometimes be challenging to navigate. Adam Gordon, 32, who works in human rights law at N.Y.U., said he remembered when he first got his membership and immediately went to the members-only section of the website. “It was a ghost town,” he said. “There was nothing on it.”Going to events in person was intimidating for Mr. Gordon, too. “Members tend to be in their 50s, 60s and 70s,” he said. “And some are pretty renowned.”The clubhouse, with its wooden walls, leather club chairs, and plaques on the wall commemorating member firsts (like the summit of Mount Everest in 1953), has a somewhat faded 20th-century grandeur that might come across as outdated to younger members.For example, the taxidermy. “The concept of Victorian hunters is quite alien to some of the younger members,” said Joshua Powell, who is deciding whether to pursue a doctorate at the University of Oxford, of a similar institution in England. “But England tried to cleanse itself entirely of it, and its clubhouse is quite stark as a result.”The Next Generation Explorers Network, or NGEN, was created in 2017. At first it was just a Facebook group where young members could share their work, ask questions and find one another. “The group currently has 175 members,” said Brianna Rowe, one of the organizers, during the annual weekend of science. After the event, membership grew to 199, pending approval from the club.The network has also started holding events like “beer and gear” nights where members talk about their favorite equipment, sometimes with an expert, like the climber Vanessa O’Brien, and seminars on how to get funding for an expedition.But these initiatives are mostly created by young members for young members. (All members are welcome in NGEN, but according to Ms. Rowe, most of the participation is by those under 40.) The big problem is how to mix the new with the old.Francesco Bandarin, the former assistant director-general for culture of Unesco and a member for about a year, said he believes the club needs to be going in this direction. “The Explorers Club has had an emphasis on geographic exploration, the South Pole, the North Pole,” he said. “It’s a little different now. We can explore the world with many more tools than hundreds of years ago. These young people are using satellites and lasers. It’s so cool.”Peter Lenahan, 62, brings young members along on expeditions he organizes, his most recent of which was a caving trip in Laos. “I’ve been leading trips for a long time, and I try to get the young people involved,” he said. “It’s really not that hard; you just have to tell them about the trip.”George Basch, 82, seemed a bit let down that more older people didn’t attend the most recent round of NGEN presentations. “It wasn’t that well advertised, and I’m disappointed the room was so small,” he said. “This is something that should have been presented to thousands of people. There were only about 20 of us old folks in the room.”But Mr. Basch planned to spread the word about the presentations. “I’m going to talk about it to everybody I meet or see the rest of the weekend,” he said. “These kids are so bright, so enthusiastic and so resourceful. Our club is lucky to have them so we won’t die out.”Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byIn 2013, the company started an ambitious, flashy effort to create robots. Now, its goals are more modest, but the technology is subtly more advanced.By Cade MetzVideos by Brian Dawson and Meg FellingMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google has quietly been retooling an ambitious but troubled robotics program that was once led by an executive who left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment. Starting in 2013, the internet company spent tens of millions of dollars buying six robotics start-ups in the United States and Japan. The project included two teams specializing in machines that looked and moved like humans. In a nod to Google’s grand ambitions, Andy Rubin, the vice president of engineering who ran the effort, called it Replicant. (The term was originally used in the science-fiction movie “Blade Runner.”)Little came of it.  Over the next few years, Google either sold off the companies it had acquired or shut them down. The best known of the bunch, Boston Dynamics, was bought by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and is still working on robots that move like humans or animals. Mr. Rubin left Google in 2014 after the harassment allegations.Google regrouped, and reconsidered its focus on the mechanics of complex robots. It has been rebuilding its program for the last few years, with robots that are much more simple than the humanoid-shaped machines that hung on the walls inside Mr. Rubin’s lab. The new effort is called Robotics at Google. It includes many of the engineers and researchers who worked under Mr. Rubin, and it is led by Vincent Vanhoucke, a principal scientist at Google. Mr. Vanhoucke, a French-born researcher, was a key figure in the development of Google Brain, the company’s central artificial intelligence lab. His team recently moved into a new lab on Google’s main campus in Mountain View. The New York Times was recently provided a first look at some of the technology the company has been working on. While the machines may not be as eye-catching as humanoid robots, Google researchers believe that the subtly more advanced technology inside them gives them more potential in the real world. The company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own, like sorting through a bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating a warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles.Google’s new lab is indicative of a broader effort to bring so-called machine learning to robotics. Researchers are exploring similar techniques at places like the University of California, Berkeley, and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab founded by the Silicon Valley kingpins Elon Musk and Sam Altman. In recent months, both places have spawned start-ups trying to commercialize their work.Many believe that machine learning — not extravagant new devices — will be the key to developing robotics for manufacturing, warehouse automation, transportation and many other tasks.“Robotics has long held the popular imagination, but what is easily the most important change is the application of machine learning,” said Sunil Dhaliwal, a general partner with Amplify Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. “The utility is in the software.”Robots are already used in warehouses and on factory floors, but they can handle only specific tasks, like picking up a particular object or turning a screw. Google wants the machines it is working with to learn on their own.On a recent afternoon inside Google’s new lab, a robotic arm hovered over a bin filled with Ping-Pong balls, wooden blocks, plastic bananas and other random objects. Reaching into this pile of clutter, the arm grabbed a banana between two fingers and, with a gentle flick of the wrist, tossed it into a smaller bin several feet away. For a robot, it was a remarkable trick. When first presented with that pile of clutter, the arm did not know how to pick up a single object. But equipped with a camera that looked down into the bin, the Google system analyzed its own progress during about 14 hours of trial and error.The arm eventually learned to toss items into the right bins about 85 percent of the time. When the researchers tried the same task, their accuracy rate was about 80 percent. It may sound simple enough, but writing computer code to tell a machine how to do that would be extremely difficult. “It is learning more complicated things than I could ever think about,” said Shuran Song, one the primary researchers on the project.Researchers believe these machines could work in warehouses and distribution centers run by companies like Amazon and UPS. Today, humans sort through items that move in and out of distribution centers. A system like Google’s could automate at least part of the process, though it is unclear when it will be ready for commercial use. Amazon, which has already deployed other kinds of robotics in its distribution centers, is interested in this kind of technology. But many robotics experts warn that moving this kind of machine learning into the real world will be difficult. Technology that does well in the lab often breaks down inside a distribution center because it can’t deal with unexpected objects it hasn’t seen before or tasks that require movements it has never tried. “This is not the right solution for all problems,” said Leif Jentoft, the chief executive of the Massachusetts company RightHand Robotics and a seasoned robotics researcher. “These technologies can sometimes seem more powerful than they are.” In another corner of Google’s lab, researchers are training robotic hands to manipulate objects — push, pull and spin them in subtle ways. The three-fingered hands are hardly complex, at least in the physical sense. The software helping them learn is the breakthrough, and researchers hope the hands can eventually learn to use tools and other equipment.Google is taking a similar approach with all its robotic hardware. The arm that tosses objects into a bin is not an elaborate machine designed by Google engineers. Built by Universal Robots, it is commonly used for manufacturing and other tasks. Google is training it to do things it couldn’t otherwise do.“Learning is actually helping us overcome the challenges of low-cost robots,” said Vikash Kumar, the Google researcher who oversees this project.In a third part of the lab, researchers are training a mobile robot sold by a Silicon Valley start-up, Fetch. This rolling machine is learning to navigate unfamiliar spaces, which can help in places like warehouses and factories.Google is tight-lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on, but as with other forms of automation, there is an obvious question of whether it will take away jobs.“It is hard to imagine a future where that is not the case,” said Michael Chui, a partner with the McKinsey Global Institute, a business research organization. But other researchers believe the robots will complement human labor instead of replacing it. “There are still so many jobs in the warehouse that robots can’t do,” said Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at Berkeley and one of the researchers behind Ambidexterous Robotics, a new start-up. “What they can do is assist with some of the drudgery.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

" AdvertisementSupported byAt the heart of homogenization lies emptiness. Anything-but-this anger follows.By Roger CohenOpinion ColumnistI read the paper the other day, a satisfying two-hour meander across the world, full of surprises, diversions and revelations. Of course newspapers are dying. This sort of unfocused experience has nothing to do with efficiency or squeezing the last drop of productivity from each minute. It may assuage the soul but is alien to the demands of contemporary hustle culture.Along the way, as sections of The New York Times accumulated on the floor, piles of paper for which trees had given their last twig, I was seized, along with my pleasurable wonderment, by a growing conviction. The system is rigged. I am no conspiracy theorist, far from it, but all the people out there who feel that their lives have passed out of their control, that they are caught in the maw of some implacable machine, have a point.Three pieces stayed with me: Erin Griffith’s vivid journey into #ThankGodIt’sMonday workaholic culture; Derek M. Norman’s elegiac lament for the demise of the Half King, killed by soaring rents beside the High Line on Manhattan’s West Side, that monument to gentrification; and Meher Ahmad’s fascinating dispatch on the bulldozing of Karachi.They were unrelated, except that none contained the words Donald Trump. No algorithm would have led me from one to the other.Yet they were intensely related in that they all told, from different angles, a story of homogenization — the prodigal child of turbocharged global capitalism. They told of sameness, of how the “authentic” becomes a packaged marketing ploy rather than the genuine fruit of a distinct culture. They told of pressure — the 24/7 pressure to conform, comply and compete — and so offered clues to the anything-but-this anger coursing through the politics of developed societies.Griffith visited various WeWork locations in New York where neon signs urge tenants to hustle harder and, as she put it, “murals spread the gospel of T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork’s water coolers have an agenda. ‘Don’t stop when you’re tired,’ someone recently carved into the floating vegetables’ flesh. ‘Stop when you are done.’” Griffith quoted a tweet from Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla: “Nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” His workweek suggestion: “about 80 sustained, peaking about 100 at times.”Sebastian Junger, author of “The Perfect Storm,” was a co-owner of the Half King, a popular New York hangout for writers and photographers. Norman quoted him: “For the last few years, the only reason this place still existed is because we loved it. We wanted to take one last stand against the ‘generification’ of New York City.”That proved impossible, just as it proved impossible to stop the bulldozing of the Empress Market in Karachi.This was a place where, as Arif Hasan, a historian and architect, put it: “You could find crafts and trades that have been wiped out elsewhere. The bird market, the bookbinders market, the dry fruit market, all stalls that have existed for well over 50 years.”Must every London gentrified street have a Starbucks, a Pret A Manger, a Caffè Nero, a Costa Coffee, a Wagamama, an Itsu, a Tesco Express, an Eat, a Hotel Chocolat, a Foxtons and a Boots? Is that all that’s left?Emptiness is what people feel. At the end of all the myriad diversions offered up by technology-at-the-service-of-efficiency lies a great hollowness. “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in,” wrote Leonard Cohen. Modernity is a crack eliminator. The only cracks it allows in its polished, glistening, purring, scented spaces are fake ones.How then is the light to penetrate, that moment of illumination that may redeem a life? How to journey when every voyage is a return to the same place? How to achieve immersion when the currency of the age is distraction? How to know community in a digital group? How to untie experience from the pressure to review it, that is to say turn experience into a measurable and salable commodity?Impunity and inequality, immigration and marginalization — many reasons have been advanced for the explosion of anger in liberal democracies that produced a nationalist, nativist and xenophobic resurgence, and an American president bent on taking the world backward.I think the emptiness produced by watching a rigged globalized system deliver homogenization on a massive scale — one way to think, one way to work, one way to conceive of profit, one way to impose a brand, one way to (not) drink at lunch, one way to eat at your desk, one way to be healthy, one way to deliver a gentrified urban neighborhood — has been underestimated as a source of disruptive fury.Techies should read Zola. They may actually believe hustle culture is the road to happiness rather than a clever ploy to extract more work. They should recall, however, that the 40-hour week was a hard-won concession, a victory for humanity over the barbaric 19th-century work conditions and relentless hours of early industrial capitalism.The pursuit of happiness does not equal the embrace of 80-hour weeks.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Jacey FortinAfter its first spaceflight in December, Virgin Galactic sent the same vessel past the edge of the atmosphere for a second time on Friday. This time, the rocket plane went higher and faster than before — and it had three crew members on board instead of two.The flight marked another step forward in a new kind of space race — one that aims to allow private citizens (who can afford the ticket) an opportunity to exit our atmosphere.It was the company’s fifth supersonic-powered test flight, and it reached an altitude of nearly 56 miles before returning safely to the Mojave Desert runway in California where it took off. Beth Moses, an astronaut trainer and microgravity research expert, was in the cabin as the company’s first test passenger in space.The SpaceShipTwo craft, a suborbital, rocket-fueled space plane called the VSS Unity, lifted off shortly after 8 a.m. local time. It was carried aloft under a larger  carrier plane for nearly an hour and then released. Next, its rocket ignited to propel the vessel, and its three crew members, up to where the sky turned black.Unity reached Mach 3 — three times the speed of sound — before the rocket motor was switched off shortly before 9 a.m. Then the vessel coasted to its highest altitude of 55.87 miles above sea level. Two tail booms rotated into a “feathered” position to create drag, allowing the vessel to fall gently back into the atmosphere and, ultimately, glide toward the runway.George T. Whitesides, the chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said the research conducted on the flight focused not only on the vessel’s trajectory, but also on the passenger experience.It went smoothly, he said. “The pilots did a great job.”The flight was a success for Richard Branson, the British billionaire who started Virgin Galactic in 2004. (Other billionaires funding private spaceflight projects include Elon Musk, who runs SpaceX, and Jeff Bezos, who is behind Blue Origin.)“Having Beth fly in the cabin today, starting to ensure that our customer journey is as flawless as the spaceship itself, brings a huge sense of anticipation and excitement to all of us here who are looking forward to experiencing space for ourselves,” Mr. Branson said in a statement on Friday.Ms. Moses’ job was to evaluate how passengers might experience a trip in the cabin. She observed the light, the temperature and the feeling of moving around in zero gravity. In an interview after the flight, she said it felt comfortable, and the view was beautiful.“It was intense and magical and serene and almost unlike anything anyone can imagine,” she said. “The earth below was super clear and bright, with a beautiful blue Pacific Ocean and snow on the mountaintops.”Ventures like these are more useful for testing the limits of tourism than for advancing scientific research, said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He said the Virgin flights could be used to conduct microgravity tests or equipment checks.“But at this stage, from a scientist’s point of view, it’s equivalent to what we call a sounding rocket,” he said. “And we’ve been doing those since the 1940s.”Sounding rockets are vessels that were sent by NASA to the upper reaches of the atmosphere to collect data and test instruments starting in 1945 — an important precursor to more advanced space travel.NASA did participate in Friday’s flight via its Flight Opportunities program, which pays Virgin Galactic for space to conduct research inside the Unity during its trip.And the three people on board — two pilots, David Mackay and Michael Masucci, and Ms. Moses — got the vantage point of a lifetime.Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.In an interview after the flight, Mr. Mackay commented on how quickly the sky turned black once the atmosphere faded, and Mr. Masucci said he was astonished by the sight of a very bright moon. They said the flight was amazing, but not frightening.“If you’re fully prepared, you don’t feel scared,” Mr. Mackay said.There is some room for debate as to whether Virgin Galactic has actually sent people into space. On both of its space trips — the vessel reached an altitude of 51.4 miles last time — the Unity flew higher than the Federal Aviation Administration’s definition of where space begins, but lower than another widely accepted boundary between Earth and space, called the Kármán Line, which is about 62 miles above sea level.In any case, Unity has flown high enough that the pilots saw a black sky above them and a blue-brown Earth below as they crested at the edge of the atmosphere. (Dr. McDowell is skeptical about the Kármán Line and thinks it is fair to say that Unity reached proper space on both of its recent trips.)Unity was the first Virgin Galactic craft to reach space, but it was not the first private spacecraft to get there. Another ship, operated by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which later licensed its technology to Mr. Branson, soared to an altitude of 69.7 miles about 15 years ago.At the time, people predicted that it was the dawn of a new age of commercial human spaceflight. But the enthusiasm faded as years passed. Some non-astronauts were flown to the International Space Station, but commercial flights did not come to fruition. Then came a tragic setback: the fatal crash of a previous SpaceShipTwo craft in 2014. One pilot was killed after he released the lock on the booms too early and the vessel fell apart, investigators found.Virgin Galactic is expected to keep doing test flights and making improvements in terms of safety, altitude and weight capacity. It is still unclear when private citizens — including the more than 600 who have already bought tickets — will be allowed to take a ride.“It’s definitely not a decade,” Mr. Whitesides said. “We are really getting pretty close.”Advertisement"

Mr. McGlashan was put on indefinite administrative leave from TPG.How the scheme worked, according to prosecutors:• William Singer masterminded the scheme through his Edge College & Career Network.• “There is a front door which means you get in on your own,” Mr. Singer told one parent in a conversation that was wiretapped. “The back door is through institutional advancement, which is 10 times as much money.” He promised a cheaper “side door.”• Parents paid Mr. Singer a total of about $25 million over eight years to bribe school officials into designating their children as recruited athletes.• Mr. Singer was accused of bribing athletic coaches to campaign for certain students who lacked athletic credentials to be admitted.• Indicted parents were also said to have paid to fake their children’s standardized tests, at a rate of $15,000 to $75,000 per exam.Britain is hurtling toward unknown political territory after Parliament again rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the E.U., Stephen Castle of the NYT writes.“Mrs. May had hoped that last-minute concessions from the E.U. would swing the vote in her favor, but many lawmakers dismissed those changes as ineffectual or cosmetic and voted against the deal, 391 to 242,” Mr. Castle writes.Lawmakers vote today on whether they wish to proceed with a no-deal Brexit. If they don’t, they will then vote on seeking an extension to the schedule for leaving.That course of action “does not solve the problems,” Mrs. May said last night. “The E.U. will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension, and the House will have to answer.”But the result throws Britain into chaos. There are just 16 days to go before Brexit is scheduled to happen by default, and with control effectively wrestled from Mrs. May the nation is seemingly rudderless. Mrs. May could seek approval for her deal one last time; Parliament could try to arrange a second referendum; or there could be a general election to break the deadlock.And the business community is unimpressed. “It’s time for Parliament to stop this circus,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of Confederation of British Industry. “This must be the last day of failed politics. Jobs and livelihoods depend on it.”More: The British government revealed plans to temporarily loosen tariffs under a no-deal Brexit, while also seeking to protect some industries, including ceramics and farming.While most of the world has grounded the jets, which have been involved in two fatal crashes within five months, American regulators have decided to keep them flying.European authorities banned the planes from the air, joining regulators in China, Indonesia, Singapore, India and Australia, as well as numerous airlines. Roughly two-thirds of the 737 Max 8 aircraft in the world are now grounded.President Trump spoke with Boeing yesterday, shortly after he had tweeted that airplanes were becoming “far too complex to fly.” In a conversation with Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s C.E.O., Mr. Trump was reportedly reassured about the safety of the Max 8 jets.The F.A.A. stands firm on its decision not to ground the aircraft, saying that it found “no basis” to do so. Elaine Chao, the U.S. transportation secretary, said that she and the F.A.A. would “take immediate and appropriate action” if necessary. (She also flew on a Max 8 yesterday.)But others disagree. Ray LaHood, a former secretary of transportation who grounded Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 following fires in its lithium-ion batteries, said that it was the F.A.A.’s duty to ground the jets “until there is 100 percent assurance” of safety. Scott McCartney of the WSJ writes that the Department of Transportation, which is home to the F.A.A., has “shown a pattern of lax regulation” recently.The U.K. has joined the growing army of voices calling for checks on the power of Big Tech, with a government report that calls for an overhaul of antitrust policies. It was prepared by a panel led by Jason Furman, who was a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. More on the news from Adam Satariano of the NYT:• “The 150-page report, ordered by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, the country’s top Treasury official, said the country needed stricter rules on acquisitions in the technology industry and stronger oversight to make sure that new rivals cannot be squashed.”• “Mr. Furman’s panel called for the creation of a ‘digital markets unit’ that would require companies to allow consumers to move data from one service to another. Large companies would also have to make data available to competitors, a bid to lower barriers to entry by forcing them to share information.”• “The report also calls for a code of conduct to be drafted for the biggest tech companies that would be enforceable with fines.”• As Grep Ip of the WSJ notes, this is “a carefully calibrated proposal designed to contain Big Tech’s threat to competition while keeping the government’s hand on the industry and the internet as light as possible.”The White House’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, won’t say whether he believes that trade talks with China will yield the results that President Trump has demanded.“Our hope is we are in the final weeks of an agreement,” Mr. Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, reports Alan Rappeport of the NYT.“We’re either going to have a good result or we’re going to have a bad result before too long, but I’m not setting a specific time frame and it’s not up to me,” he added. “I’ll work as hard as I can, and the president will tell me when the time is up, or the Chinese will.”The chances of success have risen and fallen in recent weeks. Negotiations have appeared to make progress on issues including currency manipulation and enforcement provisions. But fears about Mr. Trump’s erratic bargaining style — compounded by his decision to walk out on talks with North Korea — have given Chinese officials some jitters.Timothy Sloan went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday seeking to convince members of Congress that Wells Fargo had become a better bank — but by the time he left, few seemed to believe him, Emily Flitter of the NYT writes. Some highlights:• “Representative Katie Porter, Democrat of California, questioned Mr. Sloan about exactly how meaningful the bank’s commitment to change was, pointing out that its own lawyers had called such statements ‘corporate puffery’ in response to a lawsuit.”• “Representative Lance Gooden, a Republican from Texas, asked why Wells Fargo was taking longer than expected to refund money to customers it had tricked into buying auto insurance. Mr. Sloan said the bank had engaged in ‘a give-and-take’ with the comptroller about how much to refund.”• “A spokesman for the bank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a statement on Tuesday saying officials were ‘disappointed’ in the bank.”Mr. Sloan was the first of a parade of bank executives summoned to testify before the committee. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs will appear at a hearing on April 10.Dr. Ned Sharpless, the director of the National Cancer Institute, was named acting director of the F.D.A.Morgan Stanley promoted Lauren Cummings and Ashley MacNeill to lead its technology equity capital markets practice in the Americas.Deals• Vice Media reportedly plans to raise another $200 million, perhaps at a steep discount to its last valuation of $5.7 billion.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Virgin Galactic's goal to fly tourists into space as early as this summer is about 12 years later than initially promised by its founder, British billionaire Sir Richard Branson.But many of its customers, including Gisli Gislason, aren't sweating it.Right up there with a few minutes in space on Gislason’s bucket list is his time on earth with other space enthusiasts and Branson, a fellow adrenaline junkie known as much for his globe-trotting stunts as for starting his own airline.“It’s more than just a trip to space, it’s a huge, ongoing event,” said Icelandic ticket holder Gislason, who has a Virgin Galactic logo tattooed on his arm and bought his ticket to space in 2010. “I’ve already got what I paid for, so I’m just in for a bonus,” he added.Gislason's experience is no accident.Since its early days, Virgin Galactic specifically set out to win customer loyalty, knowing its attempt to become the world’s first commercial spaceline would likely see its share of setbacks. So featuring its top salesman Branson, the company prioritized exclusive experiences for its “future astronauts,” building a community that has stayed loyal through years of pushed deadlines and a fatal 2014 crash. (For an interactive version of this story, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Id1QMH)While waiting for their trip, some since 2004, Virgin ticket holders have been busied with treats on earth: from a custom-created solar eclipse festival in Idaho and test-flight viewings in California’s Mojave Desert to spaceship-shaped cufflinks at Christmas and group excursions to Branson's private island in the Caribbean, where they can play tennis with the famous entrepreneur and swap design ideas for the spaceflight around a campfire. “One of our astronauts once said to me, ‘Don’t fly to space, we’re thoroughly enjoying spending all this time going to the game reserve in Africa or Necker Island,’” Branson told Reuters in an exclusive interview.“That long, drawn out foreplay can be pretty good, the orgasm is quite quick,” he said, laughing. Ticket holders pay for some of these particularly high-end events, but just cover the travel for others.“That was a compelling part of the package,” said Mark Rocket, a New Zealander who changed his name nearly 20 years ago and signed up with Virgin Galactic in 2006. “It’s not just about those few minutes in space.”More than 600 people from 58 countries have put down a deposit for a 90-minute flight priced at $250,000, up from $200,000 in 2013. The first 100 “founders” will partake in a lottery to determine who gets to fly sooner rather than later. The company expects to increase the frequency of the flights as they build up their space fleet over time. It has collected about $80 million in ticket holder deposits, money which CEO George Whitesides said the company does not use for spaceship development. That funding instead comes largely from the Virgin Group and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Group. Other than stating Branson himself will be on the first scheduled flight, the company has not disclosed which ticketholders will go first – though Branson is considering the possibility of some customers jumping the line for the right price to help pay the bills. “There is a market out there we believe who would be willing to pay a million dollars to go on an earlier flight, and we’ve got a few slots at that sort of price,” Branson told Reuters.Signed-up “future astronauts” vary from billionaires to people who remortgaged their homes to pay for the ride, from pop star Justin Bieber to Mary Wallace “Wally” Funk, 80, one of the so-called ‘Mercury 13’ women who in the 1960s passed the same punishing tests as male astronauts before the program’s funding was pulled. Virgin’s decision to sign up customers long before it developed and tested a commercial spaceship contrasts with Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, which will only sell tickets for its suborbital flights after it completes its crewed flight tests.“It would not have been a Virgin company had we squirreled away in secret and built a spaceship without any customers and rolled it out once it was all ready and tested,” said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic’s commercial director and first full-time employee. Now, after a crewed SpaceShipTwo test flight to space in December 2018 and another carrying a test passenger in February, Virgin Galactic is inching closer to commercial flight. Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket has reached space but its first human spaceflight is still targeted for this year, and it has not determined a ticket price or when it will begin taking reservations.Elon Musk’s SpaceX is also in the race: last year it named Japanese fashion magnate Yusaku Maezawa as its first customer on a voyage around the moon, tentatively scheduled for 2023. “FUTURE ASTRONAUT” STRATEGYVirgin Galactic knew that the price tag for its flights, sold in advance to prove that there was a healthy market when there was a product to deliver, would require providing customer service during the wait.“Right from the start it was obvious to me that if we were going to have customers and we were accepting fairly large deposits, we were going to need to communicate regularly with those people,” said Attenborough.It was not clear how long the wait for tourist spaceflights might be, with Branson’s timelines shifting: In 2004, Virgin was saying it would offer commercial spaceflights by 2007. By 2012, the plan was 2013. As deadlines whizzed by, the future astronaut program evolved, organizing group trips from the Farnborough Air Show to the ‘Cradle of Humankind’ fossil site in South Africa.“That is something that they tapped into and wised up to really early,” said Trevor Beattie, a ticketholder and UK advertising executive working on Virgin Galactic’s marketing campaign. “They created, quite deliberately, a sense of community.”For some, access to Branson himself upped the experience.“Isn’t it funny how the wine tastes better when you know the winemaker?” said Matthew Upchurch, a ticket holder and the CEO of Virtuoso, a travel agency network with exclusive rights to sell Virgin Galactic flights in North America.CRASH TESTS LOYALTY       The biggest test of this carefully built customer community came in 2014, when a test flight crash killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot.“I remember very well waking up very early on Saturday morning after the Friday accident and wondering what would happen to this customer base,” Attenborough said.The company reached out to customers by email on the day of the crash, both before and after the co-pilot’s death was known. There was a blog post from Branson on that day, and later, a video message. A subsequent email from the astronaut relations team said that they planned to call every customer individually.“That was obviously a horrendous day for everybody,” said Branson, adding that his experience of a fatal 2007 Virgin Trains crash in which an elderly woman was killed meant he knew it was important to get to the scene of the test flight accident and “take these things head on.”In the end, Attenborough said only a “handful” of customers asked for refunds.An email seen by Reuters from the astronaut relations team three weeks after the crash said it would soon share a program of upcoming activities and trips. It advertised some “gold-dust-like spots” for a “star Galactic team” at the London Marathon – some of the sponsorship money would now go to a memorial fund for the co-pilot who was killed.After consulting with customers, the company went ahead with one of its planned annual Virgin Galactic trips to Necker Island just a few weeks after the crash.Now, after years of huge setbacks and surreal highs, Virgin Galactic’s ticketholders are edging closer to their flights. For some, space is still the final frontier.“I’ve driven a Bugatti at 253 miles an hour, I’ve skied to the South Pole, swam at the North Pole. I’ve done a lot of stuff and the thing I really want to do is fly in space,” said Jim Clash, an adventure journalist and passenger 610. (Editing by Greg Mitchell and Edward Tobin)Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.India kicks off election season, China offers trade concessions and Britain gears up for another crucial Brexit vote. Here’s the latest:General elections will kick off on April 11 and unfold in seven phases before polls will close on May 19. Results will be announced on May 23.The world’s largest democratic exercise, with some 900 million eligible voters, is widely seen as a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is running for a second five-year term.Analysis: In 2014, Mr. Modi’s promises of ambitious economic reforms won him the first single-party majority in the country in three decades.His popularity may be dented by a series of mismanaged policies and an emboldened nationalist movement associated with his Bharatiya Janata Party.On Tuesday, British lawmakers are scheduled to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s two-part blueprint for the country’s withdrawal from the E.U.Many expect Parliament to reject her plan again, leaving Britain, in all likelihood, pleading with the E.U. for an extension of the March 29 deadline for the divorce.What’s next? Mrs. May’s plan addresses trade during a transitional period immediately after Brexit that will expire in December 2020, with the potential for a two-year extension.Even if lawmakers do vote for her plan, questions about Britain’s long-term trade relationship with the E.U. would still need to be negotiated, a process that could take several more years.Go deeper: The Brexit referendum vote in 2016 exposed long-festering fissures between the country’s rural and urban populations, as well as its young and old, and ended up driving wedges between families and friends.Over the weekend, Chinese officials raised potential solutions to major roadblocks in trade talks with the U.S., possibly edging the world’s two largest economies closer to a deal.First, China would accept an enforcement mechanism that would allow the U.S. to monitor Beijing’s economic policies and unilaterally reinstate tariffs in case of violations of an agreement — if China had equal monitoring and enforcement powers.Beijing also suggested that both sides had reached an understanding to avoid deliberately devaluing their currencies for competitive advantage, but allow them to adjust for other reasons. Those are essentially the terms of an agreement China and the U.S. signed on to in 2016.Private-sector control? A Chinese entrepreneur who has accused the government in court and online of stealing his rights to coal-rich land has disappeared.As the terrorist group’s territory in Syria and Iraq shrank to little more than a speck, the Islamic State gained a footing in the southern region of the Philippines.In January, the group claimed a bombing at a cathedral that killed 23 people on the island of Jolo. The Philippine military responded with airstrikes and stationed 10,000 soldiers there.“ISIS is the most complicated, evolving problem for the Philippines today, and we should not pretend that it doesn’t exist because we don’t want it to exist,” said the chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research.History: The largely Christian nation’s Muslim minority is concentrated in the southern islands, where the lawless wilderness has been a haven for insurgencies, like Abu Sayyaf.In 2016, the Islamic State began circulating messages online to encourage those militants to join under its black flag.Ethiopian Airlines: A flight carrying more than 150 passengers crashed shortly after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing everyone aboard. Boeing identified the jet as one of its new 737 Max 8 models — the kind involved in a Lion Air flight crash in Indonesia in October that raised questions about whether pilots should have been made more aware of its new automatic controls.Japan: A ship collided with an object believed to be a whale in the Sea of Japan, injuring 80 passengers on board, according to a ferry company.Pakistan: Two climbers missing for weeks, one British and one Italian, were pronounced dead after their “silhouettes” were spotted on the Nanga Parbat mountain where they were trekking, according to Italy’s ambassador to Pakistan.North Korea: President Trump, months after declaring on Twitter that there is “no nuclear threat from North Korea,” was forced to acknowledge that Kim Jong-un had indeed continued to build out his nuclear program, even during their budding friendship and long before their second summit meeting in Vietnam.South Africa: A generation after apartheid, nearly 70 percent of farms held by individuals have white owners, fueling disappointment in the governing African National Congress and spurring some in the black majority to seize land themselves.Paul Manafort: President Trump’s former campaign chairman was sentenced to 47 months in prison for perpetuating a decades-long, multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, a relatively lenient punishment that drew sharp criticism from legal experts.Tesla: In need of a boost to its revenues and battered stock prices, the automaker is set to unveil the Model Y, an S.U.V. crossover, this week. The chief executive, Elon Musk, said it would have 10 percent more space than the Model 3 sedan and cost slightly more.

" AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBy Dan BilefskyMONTREAL — Yoshua Bengio is worried that innovations in artificial intelligence that he helped pioneer could lead to a dark future, if “killer robots” get into the wrong hands.But the soft-spoken, 55-year-old Canadian computer scientist, a recipient of this year’s A.M. Turing Award — considered the Nobel Prize for computing — prefers to see the world though the idealism of “Star Trek” rather than the apocalyptic vision of “The Terminator.”“In ‘Star Trek,’ there is a world in which humans are governed through democracy, everyone gets good health care, education and food, and there are no wars except against some aliens,” said Dr. Bengio, whose research has helped pave the way for speech- and facial-recognition technology, computer vision and self-driving cars, among other things. “I am also trying to marry science with how it can improve society.”Dr. Bengio was expounding on the promises — and perils — of A.I. on a recent day while sitting in his small, cramped office at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, a research center he founded that has made Montreal a global center for artificial intelligence. Next to him was a whiteboard covered with complex mathematical equations, along with a warning for the cleaners written in French: “Do Not Erase.”Erasing those equations could come at a heavy cost for humans as well as machines.Dr. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, is self-effacing. But his work in an area known as deep learning — “teaching machines to learn in a way inspired by how our brains compute,” he says — has already affected our daily lives in countless ways, making it possible for Google Translate to convert a sentence from French to Mandarin or for software to detect cancer cells in a medical image.He and his researchers are also harnessing A.I. to discover molecules that could cure diseases, to detect gender bias in textbooks and to predict when natural disasters will happen.Cherri M. Pancake, the president of the Association for Computing Machinery, which offers the $1 million award, credited Dr. Bengio and two other luminaries who shared the prize, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, with laying the foundation for technologies used by billions of people. “Anyone who has a smartphone in their pocket” has felt their impact, she said, noting that their work also provided “powerful new tools” in the fields of medicine, astronomy and material sciences.Despite all the accolades, Dr. Bengio recoils at scientists being turned into celebrities. While Dr. Hinton works for Google and Dr. LeCun is the chief A.I. scientist at Facebook, Dr. Bengio has studiously avoided Silicon Valley in favor of a more scholarly life in Montreal, where he also co-founded Element A.I., a software company.“I’m not a fan of a personalization of science and making some scientists stars,” said Dr. Bengio, a self-described introvert, who colleagues say is happiest when hunched over an algorithm. “I was maybe lucky to be at the right time and thinking the right things.”Myriam Côté, a computer scientist who has worked with Dr. Bengio for more than a decade, described him as an iconoclast and freethinker who would feel stymied by the strictures of Silicon Valley. A communitarian at heart, she said, he shuns hierarchy and is known for sharing the profits from his own projects with younger, less established colleagues.“He wants to create in freedom,” she said. Citing the credo of student rebels in 1968 in Paris, where Dr. Bengio was born, she said his philosophy was: “It is forbidden to forbid.”That, in turn, has informed his approach to A.I.Even as Stephen Hawking, the celebrated Cambridge physicist, warned that A.I. could be “the worst event in the history of our civilization,” and the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has cautioned it could create an “immortal dictator,” Dr. Bengio has remained more upbeat.“We need to pursue scientific knowledge, or all we will do is run against a wall,” he said. “But we need to do it wisely.” Referring to the use of algebra to compute the angles of missiles, he added: “You can’t blame the inventor of algebra for war.”Nevertheless, at a time when Facebook algorithms have come under criticism for their influence in the 2016 United States election and fears are growing that  robots could use A.I. to target humans without human oversight, Dr. Bengio is acutely aware that his innovations risk becoming “Frankenstein’s monsters.” As a result, he said, he supports regulating A.I., including an international treaty banning “killer robots” or “lethal autonomous weapons.”But he dismissed the “Terminator scenario” in which a machine, endowed with human emotions, turns on its creator. Machines, he stressed, do not have egos and human sentiments, and are not slaves who want to be freed. “We imagine our creations turning against us because we are projecting our psychology into the machines,” he said, calling it “ridiculous.”The son of Sephardic Jews from Casablanca, Morocco, who emigrated to Paris in the 1960s, Dr. Bengio traced his interest in A.I. to his childhood, when he hungrily devoured the science fiction books of Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke.He said his imagination was particularly kindled by the relationship between man and machine in Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey.” “A teacher who spends every day teaching a machine about the world resonated with me,” he said. “Science fiction was a way to dream about the future.”At the age of 11, he recalled, he began programming by plugging numbers into a calculator. Asked to recall the most formative memories from childhood, he suddenly paused and made an unlikely confession.“I don’t have a good memory — I’m good at reasoning, not at memory. That’s why I was drawn to math and computer science, as you don’t need to memorize anything.”Dr. Bengio attributed his success to his socially conscious parents, noting that his father, a pharmacist who directed theater, and his mother, who managed artists, gave him and his brother the freedom to think for themselves.It appears to have worked. His brother, Samy, one year younger, runs a research group at Google Brain, an A.I. research team. The two were “practically twins,” he said, collaborating on research and exchanging ideas.When he was 12, the family moved to Montreal, where his maternal grandparents were living. While pursuing his masters and doctorate in computer science at McGill University in the late 1980s, he recalled, he was drawn to the work of Dr. Hinton, who was striving to develop “intelligent computers” based on so-called neural networks, mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast swathes of data.“It wasn’t just some mathy thing or computer science, but about understanding human intelligence to build intelligent machines,” he said. Postdoctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bell Labs followed.Dr. Bengio noted that he, Dr. Hinton and Dr. LeCun labored on neural networks for decades, even as many in the computer science establishment dismissed them as dabblers in a form of dark magic with few, if any, practical applications. For Dr. Bengio, bucking conventional wisdom came naturally.“The big dreams of building intelligent machines faded in the late ’90s and people thought, ‘Oh, it’s too hard — let’s just use our algorithms to solve concrete problems,’” he recalled. “I guess I am not sensitive to what people care about at a particular time, and I believed in what I was doing.”While their trailblazing work transformed the field — and turned him into an A.I. superstar — Dr. Bengio still delights in spending time with students, whom he describes as a “family.” He is divorced and has two grown children, one of whom has gone into A.I. He spends his rare free moments reading Spinoza and walking in the woods near his house.Unimpressed by scientific prizes or riches, Dr. Bengio stressed that complacency and overconfidence were the enemies of scientific progress.“Being self-confident is not enough,” he said. “You can be self-confident and wrong.”Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) The last couple of weeks have been a roller coaster for Los Angeles public schoolteachers, parents and students.After months of tense back-and-forth, more than 30,000 teachers were set to walk off the job on Thursday. But on Wednesday, legal questions prompted union leaders to postpone the strike until today.And as the two sides didn’t renew negotiations over the weekend, pickets are set to begin at 7 a.m. My colleagues, like Jennifer Medina, will be covering the action today, but in the meantime, here’s what you need to know:Why are the teachers striking? Teachers and employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second-largest school system, say that working conditions have become untenable. Despite California’s reputation as a progressive bastion, the state still spends relatively little on public education — about half as much as New York spends on the average child.Now, educators are demanding higher pay, smaller class sizes and the hiring of more support staff like counselors and librarians.How did things get to this point?Money, of course.More specifically, profound disagreements about how much money the district has now and how much will likely be available in years to come.While union leaders say that the district has big reserves that could help pay for all that they’re asking, other officials — most visibly Austin Beutner, the district superintendent — say that meeting the demands would bankrupt the district.I have no ties to Los Angeles schools. Why should I care?The strike is a new front in the debate about the role of public education in American life.While teachers protesting severe underfunding of public schools have staged walkouts in six states over the past year, those have been largely in conservative or swing states with weaker unions.The strike in Los Angeles shows that even in staunchly liberal areas many of the same tensions are bubbling over. And educators’ frustrations in L.A. could ripple across the state.In Silicon Valley, for instance, teachers are facing not just tough working conditions, but also skyrocketing housing costs that often make it impossible for them to live near the students they teach.I am a parent of a child in the district. What do I need to know?You can still send your child to school, but there’s no question that classes will be disrupted: The district is enlisting highly paid substitutes and holding lessons in larger spaces.Although absences will be counted as unexcused, some parents say they’ll be keeping their children home as a show of solidarity.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

" AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Yesterday was another busy news day in California. A historically wet winter helped officially end a more than seven-year drought, and fallout from the college admissions fraud investigation continued to spread: Students spurned by universities allegedly involved have begun to sue, saying they unwittingly participated in a process rigged against them.[Here are answers to all your questions about the scandal.]But today, we wanted to dig into the Los Angeles contemporary art scene. Jason Farago, a critic for The New York Times, recently made his way west for a piece exploring L.A.’s place in a global art ecosystem. He wrote about how he approached an expansive landscape: It’s almost a rite of passage for a New York Times art critic to be sent to Los Angeles to take the temperature of the city’s museums and galleries, and to pronounce whether the second-largest city in America has “caught up” to our hometown. As long ago as 1956, one of my predecessors wrote that “spectacular myths hover with the smog over Los Angeles obscuring the considerable progress this city has made in terms of the arts during the last few years.”So when my editor and I sat down to plan my recent story on contemporary art in Los Angeles, timed to the West Coast debut of London’s Frieze Art Fair, we set ourselves some ground rules. No clichés of L.A. as a dream factory of endless sunny days. No cooing over allegedly cheaper rent, which has become a myth of its own. Even the go-to jokes about traffic no longer made sense now that the New York subway has buckled into chronic dysfunction.Over a week in Los Angeles — plus a few days in Palm Springs, scoping out the sculpture of the Desert X biennial — my priority was to assess the city on its own terms. I visited just about every museum and gallery from Brentwood to Boyle Heights.I had coffees with museum directors and beers with recent M.F.A.s, whose local concerns dovetailed with global artistic ambitions. Plunked in the middle of it all were two new art fairs — Frieze, held on the Paramount backlot, and Felix, staged in the guest rooms and cabanas of a Hollywood hotel — that were the first to draw a global audience to Los Angeles after years of false starts. (My colleague Jori Finkel had a report from the fairs.)Surveying any city’s art scene, let alone one as diverse as L.A.’s, is a game of omissions. With more space I’d have covered stalwart galleries like Regen Projects, in Hollywood; newer ones like Château Shatto, downtown; and nonprofits like Art + Practice, Mark Bradford’s space in South L.A.The collector base is growing, though it remains small relative to the city’s wealth. Alternative spaces like the Underground Museum, the Cabin, and Bel Ami are doing very good work.The city’s boosters want critics to tell you that Los Angeles is now the center of the contemporary art scene. But the truth is that no single city can lead the way in producing the art of our time. Los Angeles, like every large city, is now a constituent of a global art system, where none of us is insulated from the flows of money and images. That may not be a satisfying conclusion, but at least it gives us the space to understand this wonderful city as it really is.(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

It’s a question complicated by the typical corporate bankruptcy process, which often leaves some parties at a big disadvantage. [The New York Times]• Amid mounting controversies and a criminal investigation, two top Facebook executives are leaving, including Chris Cox, who is a member of Mark Zuckerberg’s inner circle. [The New York Times]• Still, Facebook’s daylong malfunction this week was a reminder of how many lives the company touches on a daily basis, and of the fragility of the internet. [The New York Times]• A new Stanford study looked at 100 million traffic stops. It found that black and Latino drivers were stopped more often based on less evidence. [NBC News]• After a 22nd horse died since Dec. 26, officials at Santa Anita Park banned drugs and whips. The spike in fatalities highlights horse racing’s lack of meaningful oversight, and the park’s owners said leaders needed to do better if they want the sport to survive. [The New York Times]• U.S.C. has in recent decades tried hard to overcome its reputation as a school for wealthy kids, investing in a strong athletic program and high-profile academics. But a spate of leadership failures and scandals — and now, its place in the F.B.I.’s college admissions investigation — have left Trojan family members wondering about the school’s future. [The New York Times]• Near the end of a weird week for Tesla, Elon Musk unveiled the company’s latest Model Y, a “baby S.U.V.” Yes, that means Tesla has models S, 3, X and Y, and yes, that was intentional. (Ford holds the trademark for “Model E.”) [Wired]• Each tech wave has been fueled by so-called mafias — cohorts of former colleagues who support one another’s work and fund one another’s projects. So what will a future built by Airbnb and Uber mafias look like? And who will be excluded?

Not only can you make a (relatively) quick trip to check out Estacion Federal — the hip Tijuana commons its developer recently described as “part artistic community, part commuter waypoint and part gastro-utopia” — but you’re also in a good position to check out El Jardín.

" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Melina Delkic(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Meng Wanzhou heads to court, Tesla and Facebook rethink their strategies and Virgin Atlantic makes lipstick optional. Here’s the latest:The Supreme Court of British Columbia will decide whether the Huawei executive, who has been detained since December, should be extradited to the United States, where she faces fraud charges. The proceedings began on Wednesday, with the court setting a date for the hearing.What to expect: Canada approves about 90 percent of the extradition requests it receives, so it is likely that Ms. Meng will be sent to the U.S., though it could take months.The judge will determine whether the fraud that Ms. Meng is charged with in the United States is also a crime in Canada.Her lawyers, however, will argue that the charges are politically motivated, which could potentially help her case.In other Canada news: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s former top adviser and close friend, Gerald Butts, testified before a parliamentary committee, trying to defuse a political scandal that has threatened Mr. Trudeau’s job.The United States imported more goods than ever last year, bringing its trade deficit with the rest of the world to $891.3 billion.President Trump has long been fixated on narrowing the trade deficit, which he believes is a measure of whether countries around the world are taking advantage of the U.S. Though few economists share that view, the new figures suggest that by his own metric, Mr. Trump is failing.Reasons: The increase in the amount of goods imported was driven, in part, by a broader economic slowdown and the strength of the U.S. dollar, both of which weakened global demand for American exports.The Trump administration’s trade war and tax cuts exacerbated the trend. In fact, the U.S. imported a record amount of goods from China, despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods, and American exports to China fell by nearly 50 percent in December. And money from the tax cuts helped Americans buy more imported goods.Made in America: Four companies in the U.S. were found to have falsely advertised that their products were American-made when in fact they were manufactured in China. After the North Korean leader returned from his meeting with President Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, without any sanctions relief, experts around the world wondered what he would do next.American and South Korean analysts announced on Tuesday that the country was rebuilding key missile-testing facilities, raising concerns that it was preparing to resume testing its weapons.The reasoning: North Korea may have wanted to rebuild the sites in order to make their dismantling more dramatic if the Hanoi summit meeting produced a deal, the intelligence officials were quoted as saying, or it may have wanted the option to resume rocket tests if talks broke down.The flip side: Other experts believe that a weak economy may force Mr. Kim back to the negotiating table.North Korea’s economy contracted by 3.5 percent in 2017 because of sanctions, according to South Korea’s central bank. And United Nations officials estimate that food production last year fell to its lowest level in more than a decade.After years of scandals surrounding user privacy, the world’s largest social network will prioritize private and encrypted communication between users, shifting away from its founding principles of public sharing and an open platform.“I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today’s open platforms,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said in a blog post.Details: Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to spend the years ahead building systems and products that create a type of “digital living room” where people can communicate privately across all of the company’s networks — Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.In other business news: Tesla is shutting down most of its stores — just three months after a sprint to open new locations — in an effort to cut costs at a time when investor confidence in the company and its founder, Elon Musk, is wavering. Grab: The Singapore-based ride-hailing giant, which serves eight countries in Southeast Asia, secured a $1.5 billion investment from SoftBank, bringing its current valuation to about $14 billion, according to a person briefed on the matter.Carlos Ghosn: The former Nissan chairman may have gotten out on bail before his trial — a relatively rare feat in Japan — but he faces steep odds: Japanese prosecutors have a 99 percent conviction rate with indicted defendants.Michael Cohen: Six checks from President Trump to his former personal lawyer that were obtained by The Times show how he paid to keep secrets private while in the White House.Solomon Islands: An oil spill from a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship that ran aground last month is spreading toward a World Heritage site, East Rennell, alarming environmentalists and government officials. Officials in Australia, which has a close relationship with the Solomon Islands, said they would send vessels, equipment and experts to help contain the damage.Italy: The Benetton family, known widely for its clothing brand, also owns Autostrade per l’Italia, or Highways for Italy, a private company that managed the bridge that collapsed in Genoa last year, killing 43 people. The calamity is now the subject of a criminal inquiry.Virgin Atlantic: The British airline sent a note to its female flight attendants, instantly recognizable in their sleek red skirts and crimson lipstick, that they no longer have to wear any makeup and can choose to wear pants.Goldman Sachs: Executives at the Wall Street giant told employees in an internal memo that the company would be adopting a more “flexible” dress code in an attempt to lure younger workers who might be considering careers in Silicon Valley, where jeans and sneakers are the norm.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Match sweet, tangy citrus with peanuts and avocado for a satisfying salad.Tours by and for women have grown in popularity, from bonding on a polar bear cruise in Norway to a cultural retreat in Calgary. Here are four destinations to consider.Lighting, textiles, throw pillows and smells: There are ways to style a room on a budget; all you really need is a bit of imagination and patience.If you’re about to open a can of something tasty, thank the French. And the British.In the late 1700s, Napoleon was on the move, invading Italy, Austria and Egypt. Feeding his enormous armies was a problem — he needed a way to keep food from spoiling.A confectioner, Nicolas Appert, spent years coming up with a successful process. He placed fruits, vegetables and meats in glass bottles, corked and wired them, then boiled the bottles for hours. He didn’t know he was killing microbes — he just knew that the more heat and less air, the better.By 1810, Napoleon’s government handed him a 12,000-franc prize and required him to publish a book, with the catchy title, “The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances for Many Years.”Glass, unfortunately, breaks.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The future of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 plane is in question after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed yesterday, killing 157 people.The Ethiopian Airlines flight was the second disaster involving the jet in five months, after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia killed 189 people in October. It’s rare for two planes of the same model to be involved in accidents in such a short time span, the NYT reports.The 737 Max is core to Boeing’s business. It’s the company’s best-selling model (list price: $120 million). Since its introduction in 2017, 350 planes have been delivered, and 5,000 more are currently on order. Chris Bryant of Bloomberg Opinion notes that its success is why Boeing shares are near a record high — though shares were down sharply in premarket trading.China and Indonesia have grounded the Max 8 jets. China’s airlines had been enthusiastic customers of the new model, but as of this morning they’ve been flying 737-800s instead.Concerns may give rivals a leg up. The 737 Max was created to counter Airbus’s latest A320 variant. Meanwhile, the Chinese plane maker Comac has been testing the C919, a rival of those jets, and has hoped to find buyers beyond China.Undeterred by a recent loss to Democrats, President Trump is expected to ask for $8.6 billion to finance a border wall in the next White House budget, which is to be sent to Congress today.• The proposal also includes $3.6 billion to replenish military construction funds that were diverted under a national emergency declaration.• “I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance,” said Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser.• Democrats rebuffed the proposal. “Congress refused to fund his wall, and he was forced to admit defeat,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. “The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again.”The request is largely for show. As the NYT notes, the White House budget “will serve more as a statement of values and a vehicle for political positioning than a plausible outline for how the government will actually raise and spend money.”Don’t expect the budget to be balanced, regardless of whether the wall funding is included.[Sign Up for the DealBook Newsletter and make sense of major business and policy headlines.]In a push to strike a trade deal, the U.S. may be at risk of signing a watered-down agreement.A potential compromise could enable a deal to be reached this spring, Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson write.• Washington has been pushing Beijing to agree to a so-called enforcement mechanism that would allow the U.S. to monitor China’s behavior and impose penalties for violations.• Wang Shouwen, China’s vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations, said on Saturday that China would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions.But China’s promises not to manipulate its currency don’t seem to be particularly original, Mr. Bradsher writes:• American negotiators want China to avoid devaluing its currency to achieve a competitive advantage for their exports.• But “currency provisions of the evolving trade agreement are essentially a reaffirmation of the statement that the G-20 economies, including China, issued” in 2016.The bigger picture is a growing concern that, as the NYT Editorial Board points out, the Trump administration “may settle for an ephemeral victory at the expense of America’s long-term economic interests.”Tomorrow, the British Parliament is to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the E.U. Right now, its chances for approval don’t look good.Talks between Britain and Brussels are deadlocked, according to Mrs. May’s office. Negotiators have been trying to secure last-minute changes to win over British lawmakers, after a previous version of the agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament.Some hard-line Brexiters say defeat is “inevitable.” And a former Brexit secretary, David Davis, has said that even a proposal for Mrs. May to step down in exchange for support of her deal would “not get the vote through.”Meanwhile, those who want to stay in the E.U. have “wind in the sails,” according to the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said over the weekend that there is a real risk of “losing Brexit.” If Mrs. May’s deal is rejected, lawmakers would vote on whether to reject a no-deal Brexit and delay the withdrawal process. That could increase the chances of a second referendum.More: Brexit has reportedly spurred financial firms to move $1.2 trillion in assets and funds out of Britain. And the Bank of England has told some British lenders to triple holdings of easy-to-sell assets to weather a no-deal Brexit.The Fed chairman gave a rare interview to “60 Minutes” about the economy, future interest rate increases — and whether President Trump could dismiss him.On job security: Here’s the exchange between Mr. Powell and Scott Pelley of “60 Minutes”:Pelley: Can the president fire you?Powell: Well, the law is clear that I have a four-year term. And I fully intend to serve it.Pelley: So no, in your view?Powell: No.On the U.S. economy: Mr. Powell said that America was in “a good place,” with a favorable outlook on inflation. The Fed’s interest rate policy, he added, is “appropriate.” (Translation: Don’t be surprised if the Fed keeps rates steady until it has a better idea of the outlook for the year.)On the global economy: Mr. Powell feels more concerned, telling Mr. Pelley, “We’ve seen increasing evidence of the global economy slowing down.” The biggest potential shocks to the U.S., the Fed chairman said, could come from slower growth in China and Europe, as well as Brexit.More: How central bankers around the world are taking cues from the Fed by reducing interest rate increases to cushion slowing economies.We’re now a decade into one of the great rallies in stock market history, which has seen the S&P 500 surge 305 percent and the creation of $30 trillion in wealth. Matt Phillips tried to explain why  most Americans are subdued after the latest rally:• “To buy stocks, you need money. After watching their fortunes — and retirement funds — shrivel, few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten-down stocks.”• “Even those who are invested are behaving differently, both in how they invest and what they’re doing with the proceeds.”• “In 2017, 43 percent of all the money in American stock market funds was in index funds. Back in 2007, only 19 percent of stock market assets were in these passive strategies, a style of investing that acknowledges that, for most people, trying to beat the market through savvy trading is a mug’s game.”• “The psychological and financial damage inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession continue to weigh heavily.”• Research suggests that “enduring financial traumas at a relatively young age can shape people’s behavior for decades.” That could mean that younger Americans “are unlikely to be eager to take big risks in the stock market any time soon.”A year ago, Twitter’s C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, said that he wanted the company to make the conversations on its platform healthier. Kurt Wagner of Recode finds that the effort is failing.• “There’s no widely adopted way to quantify the health of human interaction, especially at the internet’s scale.” But the measures that Twitter and researchers are considering include a “toxicity” metric and one that takes note of civility, receptivity and constructivity, helped by researchers from Oxford and Leiden Universities.• “The research teams that Twitter announced last July to help them work on this project haven’t even started. One of the two teams has abandoned the project altogether. Internal metrics Twitter is building on its own are still in the ‘experimentation’ phase and aren’t being tested in the wild.”• “Lawyers for Twitter and Leiden haven’t been able to solidify the data-sharing and privacy details for the partnership, which means the researchers are simply waiting.”In an op-ed for the FT, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., writes that it’s time to overhaul international corporate tax rules:• “The ease with which multinationals seem able to avoid tax and the three-decade-long decline in corporate tax rates compromise faith in the fairness of the international system.”• One solution, she says, is to create minimum-tax schemes. “Reduce the scope for shifting profits to low-tax locations,” she suggests, or “allow low-income countries to retain more revenue by imposing minimum withholding taxes on cross-border payments.”• Another is to “create a system that fully taxes routine profits — something like a normal return on investment — on basic activities in the country in which they take place, while splitting any remaining profits among all the relevant nations.”Sam Altman stepped down as president of Y Combinator, but remains chairman of the start-up incubator.Bill Shine stepped down as White House communications director to take a position on President Trump’s re-election campaign.Bank of America named James Robertson and Peter Luck as co-heads of investment banking for Britain.DealsNvidia agreed to buy the chip maker Mellanox for about $7 billion.

His name is Fraz Penzig — Fraz being how his father, Frank, once heard himself paged over a static-filled airport loudspeaker. “Penzig men,” writes Sam Lipsyte. “Always hovering just outside of an inside joke they have played on themselves.” It’s hard to diminish a character faster than naming him for a mistake, but we soon learn that Fraz is abrasive and useless at his job. He has a porn fetish that’s common knowledge in his grossed-out social circle. His 8-year-old twins may have rectal parasites. His wife, Tovah, enjoys French-kissing one of Fraz’s childhood rivals. “Tovah told him that life is not a zero-sum game, but Fraz senses that if it were, he would be the zero sum.”Hark Morner is also named for a mistake, this one involving a foreign-born mother and a Christmas carol. “She thought the song was about someone telling their friend Hark that the herald angels were singing,” Hark tells Fraz. But where Fraz has been sinking since birth, Hark is rising — as in “glory to the newborn king” rising — through mental archery, a quasi-religious mindfulness regimen of his own creation. He’s still in the pamphlet-selling phase when he meets Fraz, and he’s not the chattiest messiah. But when Hark speaks, “his voice is an enchanted river with roars and hushes and thick, crystal swerves. It carves a course for Fraz to follow, to flow toward, out from his fetid backwaters, his brack stink.”[ The paper’s 2010 review of “The Ask” called it “the sort of book that, if it were an animal, would be a lumbering, hairy, cryptozoological ape-man with a near-crippling case of elephantiasis.” ]The attraction and repulsion between would-be Jesus and his apostle Costanza is a major story line in “Hark,” though it’s hardly the only one. “Hark” is Lipsyte’s first novel since 2010’s much-loved “The Ask,” and similarities abound. Both are satires featuring underemployed, middle-aged New York Jewish protagonists with abandoned artistic dreams, cheating wives and snack-food obsessions. That’s a pretty specific box on the census form for a writer to check twice. Both also veer away from narrative to chase any excuse for a riff — then swing back with prose so good you feel guilty complaining about the whiplash. The difference is that in “Hark” the riffing has more serious consequences.“Hark” is split into halves, the first of which is extremely funny. In a few swift pages we learn that Hark started as a stooge on the corporate speaker’s circuit, hired to bore audiences with meaningless aphorisms (“You are the arrow! But you are also what it pierces”) until an executive ringer would eject him from the stage to heroic applause. “Hark wasn’t the only person who worked this niche. A guy named Cornelius the Corporate Impostor had the gig before Hark. Big Lev from Biz Dev had sewn up Silicon Valley. But they were too broad. Nobody bought their acts after a line or two. Hark twitched with the plausible.” [Read: Sam Lipsyte on the role of sex scenes in fiction.]In the midst of these gigs, Hark has his revelation. It’s a recurring joke that no one can explain mental archery beyond its “focus on focus,” but pamphlets are written, yoga poses created (“Priapic Centaur, Roaring Rama, Encircling Sioux”), and a core of acolytes gather. There’s the heiress Kate Rumpler and Teal, Kate’s anticapitalist, ex-convict ex-girlfriend. (Kate: “You did do time for embezzlement.” Teal: “That company was building fascism in America. And its shipping policies were absurd.”) Kate funds Hark with her inheritance. Teal runs Hark Hub, home of the latest Hark videos and social threads. Fraz fancies himself the movement’s Steve Bannon, while the others regard him as its Michael Cohen. All are mired in ironic detachment from their misery and attracted to Hark’s simple message. But they’re unsure if his odd speech and mannerisms are signs of sanctity or just weirdness. “Maybe Fraz is too impure to know the difference.”Having dropped Hark at the edge of a Tony Robbins-like breakthrough in Part 1, the story unravels some in Part 2 — for Hark and for “Hark.” Lipsyte crowds the plot with a stalker/Svengali, an organ-donation kidnapping thingumajig, and an Elon Musk-y villain, complete with surgically dyed irises, who exists mostly as a reason for Lipsyte to groove on big tech. He also shoves his skeptical Greek chorus aggressively toward belief, leading to lines like this from Fraz to Kate: “There’s something a little too uncomplicated in Hark for people like us. Thing is, we’ve got to change, not him.”That’s a honker of a passage, though it serves Lipsyte’s point — that modern life is so grim, people will bend far below the limbo bar of logic in search of some peace. Even the author can’t make up his mind about Hark and mental archery. “Fraz does believe,” he writes, only to double back a few sentences later and suggest that he doesn’t.But the battle between Hark and Fraz is never a fair fight. Regardless of the deficiencies Lipsyte piles onto them, Fraz, Kate, Teal and others are fully formed characters. We know Fraz’s inner life, see moments of tenderness with his kids, and even get the occasional glimpse of his appeal. Calling back to Fraz’s courtship with Tovah, Lipsyte writes: “He told her to consider him a downed wire: unpredictable, potentially lethal. Tovah thought him more a lost shoelace, but adorable.”Hark, meanwhile, is a great idea and a lousy character. He’s only ever alive as a vessel for riffs about belief, fraud, transcendence, corporate off-sites, etc. Many of these are dazzling, but hardly all of them, and Hark is in the book a lot. There’s considerable time given to his speeches: “What we learn from the example of the Mongols.…” Meta, sure. But meta-boring is still boring. In an attempt to give Hark a bit more flesh some information gets sprinkled in — he’s a cop’s kid, his favorite drink is ice — but it’s a tough sell that smart, damaged, witty, miserable people would lend Hark their attention for longer than it would take to ridicule him. Let alone devote their tiny reservoirs of hope to something as inchoate as mental archery.Lipsyte tries to give his characters cleaner moments of salvation before wrapping things up, but this being a Christ allegory tucked inside a satire, it’s safe to say it doesn’t end terribly well for anyone. It’s a shame. Not only because so much of “Hark” is brilliantly alive, but because everyone in it could use a bit of mercy.Josh Tyrangiel is the executive vice president of news at Vice and the former editor of Bloomberg Businessweek.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Melina Delkic(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The U.S. and North Korea try to reach a deal for a second time, India escalates hostilities with Pakistan and the universe confounds astrophysicists. Here’s the latest: President Trump landed in Hanoi, Vietnam, to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for the second time in eight months. The two leaders, who in 2017 exchanged fiery threats, will have dinner together tonight and a series of formal meetings the next day.Both sides have plenty at stake. Their last meeting ended with a vaguely worded agreement that spurred little concrete action.What North Korea wants: Pyongyang has a long list of demands, including an elimination of sanctions, a formal end to the Korean War with a peace treaty and, possibly, the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. The troops have functioned as a deterrent against the North since 1953 when the two sides signed an armistice that simply halted the war.What the U.S. wants: Mr. Trump seems to be tempering expectations, moving away from discussing the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” but still seeking a timeline.On the eve of his meeting with Mr. Kim, the president said he didn’t want to “rush anybody.” “As long as there is no testing, we’re happy,” he said. Go deeper: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has his work cut out for him as the translator of Mr. Trump’s seemingly capricious foreign policy decisions. Here’s an in-depth profile of the former C.I.A. director, one of the last remaining members of the president’s original White House team.For the first time in five decades, Indian warplanes crossed into Pakistan.India said it had struck “the biggest training camp” of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist group that claimed responsibility for this month’s suicide bombing in the Kashmir Valley.But Pakistan’s chief military spokesman said the jets just dipped in and out of its airspace and dropped a payload in a forested area, doing little damage. That view is supported by military analysts and two Western security officials.Analysis: With India claiming it had avenged the terrorist attack and Pakistan claiming no real damage had been done, both nuclear-armed countries left room for defusing the situation.But analysts warned that Pakistan could still retaliate. Today, the country’s prime minister, Imran Khan, will meet with the National Command Authority — the body that oversees the deployment and management of Pakistan’s nuclear arms. The British prime minister said Tuesday that Parliament should have a chance to delay Brexit if it rejects her plan, bowing to pressure to reduce the risk of a chaotic “no deal” departure from the E.U.Her hand was forced when rebels in her Conservative government threatened to vote for a forced extension of talks with the bloc.Next steps: Mrs. May plans to bring her revised deal to Parliament by March 12. If lawmakers reject the deal, she said they could vote in the next two days on whether to delay an exit for a short time or opt for a “no deal” departure. A postponement would require the consent of all 27 other E.U. governments.Go deeper: Ever wonder what happens in those Brexit talks at the European Union headquarters in Brussels? According to a confidential document obtained by The Times, not very much. Sentencing proceedings for Cardinal George Pell, the highest ranking Roman Catholic cleric to be convicted of sexual abuse, are expected to begin today. The process could take days. The cardinal, who was an adviser to Pope Francis, is facing anywhere from a handful of years to a maximum 50-year prison term after being convicted in December of sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys. He has been expelled from a group of papal advisers.Timing: The verdict was unsealed on Tuesday, only after prosecutors decided they would not proceed with a second trial for an additional round of assault allegations and a gag order was lifted. The order had prevented news outlets operating within Australia, including The Times, from reporting the verdict to readers in the country. This is the article The Times published in print only, to comply.Behind the secrecy: Our Australia bureau chief explains how the country shrouds law enforcement and the courts in unusual secrecy, particularly in cases of sexual and family violence. Officials say it protects victims and defendants, but critics say it disadvantages victims.Michael Cohen: President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer is spending several days this week testifying on Capitol Hill. A person familiar with his plans said that on Wednesday, in a public session before a House committee, he will most likely describe what he says is the president’s possible criminal conduct and go into “granular detail” about the plan to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress.Elon Musk: The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a federal court to hold the Tesla chief executive in contempt of court for posting an updated production outlook on Twitter without first seeking legal approval, in violation of his settlement with the commission last year.Huawei: The United Arab Emirates said it still planned to use equipment from the Chinese tech giant to build its high-speed wireless network, the latest setback for the American-led campaign to curtail the company’s reach.Yogurt: In South Asian households, cultures of the tart dairy product are akin to heirlooms, preserved for years and passed down to help churn out new batches. “I can’t recall a single day, growing up, when the fridge was without yogurt, or as it’s known in Hindi, dahi,” writes Priya Krishna, a frequent contributor to our culinary coverage.Britain: Under new rules, all adults will be considered potential organ donors by 2020 unless they opt out, flipping the current system. Sex education: English schools, particularly those that receive government funds, will significantly broaden sex education to cover topics including gay relationships, transgender people and more. Not everyone is happy.The universe: It seems to be expanding far more rapidly than it should be. And astrophysicists have struggled to account for the discrepancy. We’ll leave the details to our science writer Dennis Overbye, who has a way with words (and a physics degree from M.I.T.).Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Make chicken piccata, and rejoice over its butter-rich pan sauce.Choosing a perfume or cologne is tough, but we have experts to help you find a fragrance that you’ll love.Why we yawn remains a mystery, but one theory is that it cools off our brains.This week, the U.S. vice president, Mike Pence, accused Uruguay of being a “bystander” in Venezuela’s crisis, calling on its center-left government to do more to end President Nicolas Maduro’s devastating reign.A reader, Annelise Gasser of Quebec, asked how a tiny South American nation acquired such diplomatic significance.To start, Uruguay is arguably the only South American nation with clean democratic credentials that maintains decent relations with Mr. Maduro. Credibility with both Maduro supporters and opponents make it a natural intermediary in any negotiated transition.Uruguay’s soft approach stems from a live-and-let-live attitude, developed over two centuries of coexistence with much bigger neighbors. The country has long led the region in progressive politics, legalizing marijuana and gay marriage.While hard-liners in Miami threaten military intervention to oust Mr. Maduro, on the laid-back streets of Montevideo, residents resolve most of their problems over a slow barbecue and the ever-present thermos of caffeine-rich mate (pronounced MAH-tay).Anatoly Kurmanaev, our Caracas-based reporter, wrote today’s Back Story.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Jose A. Del Real, Joe Coscarelli and Niraj ChokshiLOS ANGELES — It had become an inspiring symbol of success in South Los Angeles, but on Monday the Marathon Clothing store was transformed into a makeshift memorial for the rapper Nipsey Hussle, the co-owner, who was fatally shot outside its doors, stunning fans across the city and the music world.Some prayed and cried, while others left candles, flowers and signs to express their condolences for Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, who had grown up in the Crenshaw area and stayed on to help his neighborhood even after becoming big enough to make it out. A steady flow of passing cars on Slauson Avenue blared tracks from his latest album.Bela Vega, 28, a fan, fought back tears as she explained how Hussle, 33, had given hope to people who had also grown up around gang violence. His fans and neighbors clung to lyrics and interviews in which he advocated self-improvement; his financial investments in the community, she said, showed he was serious about creating a ladder for other people who had grown up in similar circumstances. But now, his death, and the questions surrounding it, have reignited longstanding fears about violence and despair in the area.“The story repeats over and over again, and you just ask, ‘When does it stop?’” Ms. Vega said. “This is our community. But do I want my son to grow up over here? No. No.”Two others were wounded in the shooting, and a suspect has yet to be identified, according to the police.Hussle remained a regular presence at the strip mall off Crenshaw Boulevard that houses Marathon. Outside the store on Monday, mourners shared stories about times they had summoned up the courage to say hello to him and the smiles he had flashed back.[More than a dozen people were injured as a stampede broke out at a memorial for Nipsey Hussle.]“He meant everything to the community,” said Lesly Marroquin, 26. “This was all him. His music, he speaks real facts. He talks about how he grew up. He wanted people to see what he went through, to show people they could change. He was a role model.”The area, comprising several predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in South Los Angeles, is home to many working- and middle-class families. Its streets are lined with single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings, while its main boulevards and thoroughfares feature strip-mall businesses and fast-food restaurants. The area has a troubled history with gang violence, something Hussle addressed in his music. Crime has remained a significant concern, residents said Monday, even as citywide rates have fallen in recent decades.An autopsy found that Hussle died from gunshot wounds to the head and torso, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner determined. Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department noted Sunday night that in one week there had been 10 homicides and 26 shooting victims across Los Angeles. “That’s 36 families left picking up the pieces,” he said on Twitter. Despite those numbers, the yearly total of homicides in the city of Los Angeles, which includes Crenshaw, has decreased steeply in the last 30 years, from a peak of 1,092 in 1992 to 259 in 2018.Still, Hussle made improving South Los Angeles a priority. After his rap career took off, he diversified beyond the music industry, becoming a local businessman and philanthropist.“From the beginning, Nipsey Hussle has been a critical part of #DestinationCrenshaw, even inspiring the name!” Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a city councilman who represents South Los Angeles, said on Instagram. Destination Crenshaw is a project devised to promote black cultural history in South Los Angeles.Last year, Hussle, who taught himself how to build computers, helped open a center in Crenshaw dedicated to connecting underrepresented groups with technology companies, according to an interview with The Los Angeles Times.“Growing up as a kid, I was looking for somebody — not to give me anything — but somebody that cared,” he told the newspaper. “Someone that was creating the potential for change and that had an agenda outside of their own self interests.”As a teenager, he dropped out of high school and became involved in street life and joined a gang, according to interviews, as he tried to start a rap career.He began releasing music in the mid-2000s, and first made his name with the “Bullets Ain’t Got No Name” series of mixtapes, which established him as an inheritor of the storied lineage of Los Angeles gangster rap, carrying a torch lit by N.W.A, Snoop Dogg and DJ Quik. He was a muscular rapper who delivered direct, unromanticized lyrics about navigating the challenges of street life.On singles like “Hussle in the House,” which had the trademark g-funk synthesizer whine and a reference to “Straight Outta Compton,” Hussle rapped authoritatively as a resident of Crenshaw and especially the notorious Slauson Avenue. “I’m from where homicide boost the economy,” he delivered matter-of-factly. “I came from nothing/so did every other rapper/save the speculation/real banger, gun clapper.”Slender and a little grizzled, with slick braids and a grown-out beard, he identified as a member of the Rollin 60’s Crips gang, which he chalked up to history, circumstance and survival. “I’m not promoting it. I’m just speaking on it,” he said in a 2010 interview with Complex magazine.“I feel like I’m an ambassador,” the rapper added. “I’m more focused on giving solutions and inspiration more than anything.”He had plans to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to talk about preventing gang violence, according to Steve Soboroff, the Los Angeles police commissioner.As his music career careened forward, Hussle largely stayed the independent route, releasing most of his projects through the All Money In label that he founded in 2010. But his entrepreneurial streak often earned more attention than his songs, namely the marketing coup tied to his 2013 mixtape “Crenshaw,” in which he sold 1,000 copies for $100 each (including 100 copies to Jay-Z, who respected the hustle).The move came as digital piracy and free music online had all but sapped CDs of value, leading Hussle to start his #Proud2Pay movement. “It ISN’T the price of the plastic case and polyurethane disc,” he said at the time, “it’s the price of Revolution! The price of Rebellion against an industry that has tricked us all into making products that have no soul for fear of not being heard if we don’t.”It wasn’t until last year that he released his proper debut studio album, “Victory Lap,” via Atlantic Records (in partnership with All Money In). The LP debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart and was nominated for best rap album at the Grammys, losing to Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy.”He collaborated with a wide array of rappers, including Drake, the Game, Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino, Rick Ross and YG. He was an occasional actor and had a memorable performance as a rapper having a feminist awakening on the CW sitcom “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.”Hussle also guest-starred on YG’s anti-Trump hip-hop anthem “FDT,” rapping: “I’m from a place where you prolly can’t go/speakin’ for some people that you prolly ain’t know/it’s pressure built up and it’s prolly gonna blow.”At the same time as he released “Victory Lap,” which featured Puff Daddy and Kendrick Lamar, Hussle helped open a 4,700-square-foot co-working space in Crenshaw called Vector 90, dedicated to increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.“In our culture, there’s a narrative that says, ‘Follow the athletes, follow the entertainers,’” he told The Los Angeles Times last year. “And that’s cool but there should be something that says, ‘Follow Elon Musk, follow Zuckerberg.’ I think that with me being influential as an artist and young and coming from the inner city, it makes sense for me to be one of the people that’s waving that flag.”He added: “I just want to give back in an effective way.”His death drew condolences from across the music industry and beyond, with everyone from Drake and Rihanna to Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook recognizing the stamp he left on his city.“It’s dangerous to be an MC,” Nas wrote on Instagram. “It’s dangerous to have money. Dangerous To Be A Black Man... Nipsey is a True voice. He will never be silenced.”Hussle was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London, with whom he had a son, Kross. He also had a daughter, Emani, from a previous relationship.Outside the Marathon store on Monday, Marcus Adams, 24, said the rapper “was an inspiration” for him as a young black man who grew up in South Los Angeles. Mr. Adams, who is studying business administration at West Los Angeles College, said Hussle’s music reflected his own experience trying to avoid the pitfalls of growing up in an impoverished community.“I came because I just felt I owed it to him,” he said. “It’s a job to come here and show my condolences.”Jose A. Del Real reported from Los Angeles. Joe Coscarelli and Niraj Chokshi reported from New York. Jon Caramanica contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Many airlines take their Boeing 737 Max 8 models out of service, Indians rally behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkey enters an economic recession. Here’s the latest: What brought an Ethiopian Airlines flight down just minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 aboard, has not been determined. But while the investigation proceeds, at least 22 carriers have taken the Boeing model involved out of service, including all those operating in China and Indonesia.Follow our live coverage of the latest developments here.The accident was the second in recent months involving Boeing’s new 737 Max 8. In October, a Lion Air flight crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff. Aviation authorities have been looking into the possibility that incorrect data might have activated new anti-stall software that kept pushing the nose downward — and that pilots may not have been made fully aware of.On the ground: The plane’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered, Ethiopian Airlines said. The pilot sent out a distress call and was cleared to return to the airport shortly before the crash.Victims: The passengers on the plane were from all parts of the world, including professors from Kenya, an underwater archaeologist and U.N. workers from a variety of countries.Traveling soon? Here’s how to find out if your next flight is on a Max 737. And you can send your questions about the plane to our reporters. A month ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chances of winning a second term seemed weakened. But after a suicide bombing in Kashmir set off weeks of military brinkmanship with Pakistan, even once-critical Indians have started rallying behind him.That India’s airstrikes probably missed their targets, and that a fighter jet was shot down by Pakistan, don’t seem to matter.“Whatever our criticisms about him regarding the economy and jobs, at the end of the day he has done an incredible job of delivering justice for the martyrs,” said a law student and first-time voter.Context: India has a Westminster-style parliamentary system. For Mr. Modi to return to power in the coming general elections, which start on April 11, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party need to win a majority of the 543 electable seats in the lower house, the Lok Sabha.The opposition Congress Party is trying to sway the conversation back toward domestic issues, like the sputtering economy and a spike in hate crimes against minority groups.The country’s electric system has been down for more than four days, plunging most of the country into sporadic darkness and adding further uncertainty to the country’s economic and political crises.The country’s largest power producer went down on Thursday, and no date has been set to restart the plant. Looting and protests have broken out, and desperate patients have been begging doctors to be kept alive.Finger-pointing: President Nicolás Maduro blames U.S. sabotage and cyberattacks for the blackout, without providing evidence. Energy experts and Venezuelan power sector contractors dismiss that explanation, instead pointing to mismanagement and corruption.Related: The U.S. claimed that Mr. Maduro’s supporters had set fire to a convoy of humanitarian aid, but an investigation by The Times found that the actual cause was more likely a Molotov cocktail thrown by an anti-government protester.Prime Minister Theresa May flew to Strasbourg, France, to attempt to rescue her unpopular withdrawal plan.It’s unclear what kind of concessions she can win in the 11th hour meeting that would prevent Parliament from voting the plan down today.What next? If she loses, Mrs. May has promised to offer a vote on whether Britain should leave the E.U. without a deal — a scenario that could brutally upend the country’s economy and one that a majority of lawmakers oppose.Related: A protest by customs officers in France has delayed Eurostar trains and backed up trucks for miles, providing Britain with a cautionary tale of a post-Brexit world. Afghanistan: As its peace talks with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar, entered an extraordinary third week, the Taliban pressed its offensive in the western Badghis Province, killing 16 Afghan National Army soldiers and capturing 40 — an entire company — in a large-scale attack.U.S.-China trade war: In a high-stakes diplomatic negotiations with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s strategy of relying heavily on his own personality and ability to read people failed. The same strategy faces a serious test with Mr. Xi.Malaysia: An Indonesian woman who was accused two years ago of smearing a lethal nerve agent on Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was released without explanation. The fate of a second suspect in the killing remains uncertain.Turkey: The country is officially entering a recession, with government figures showing two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth. The currency has tumbled and investor concerns are rising, a damaging combination for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of crucial elections at the end of the month.U.S. budget: President Trump sent Congress the largest spending plan in federal history, requesting $4.75 trillion for the next fiscal year. His proposal — which would increase military spending and fund a border wall with Mexico while sharply cutting domestic programs, like education and environmental protection — was declared dead on arrival by Democrats in the House and Senate.Tesla: Days after its chief executive, Elon Musk, announced that the carmaker would shut most of its dealerships, the company reversed course, saying that it would keep “significantly more stores open” and that it would raise prices for most of its cars worldwide by 3 percent.Super bloom: Forest fires followed by heavy rains in California this year have spurred colorful wildflowers to blossom across the state, turning arid landscapes into explosions of purples, yellows and greens.The internet: The memes, Wikipedia pages and emails that you look at every day travel to your device via nearly 750,000 miles of extremely thin cables strung across the ocean floor.

Boycott, the land agent for a wealthy nobleman, was responsible for evicting those on his employer’s 40,000 acres. When he tried, the Irish National Land League suggested nonviolent protest. Boycott’s neighbors shunned him. Stores declined to serve him, his laborers quit and jeering mobs followed him.Boycott’s plight attracted international attention, including front-page stories in The New York Times.Boycott left Ireland, but his name remained, reportedly popularized by a priest who thought “ostracize” would confuse common people.Within months, The Times was using it to describe events elsewhere in the world.Aodhan Beirne wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day. By Penn Bullock(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Boeing on the defensive, hours until a crucial Brexit vote and Venezuela’s blackout threatens social implosion. Here’s the latest: What exactly brought down an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner just minutes after takeoff on Sunday has not been determined, but both the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered. Here’s what we know, and our live coverage. The crash of Flight 302 killed 157 people from around the world, including professors from Kenya, aid workers from Ethiopia, a career ambassador from Nigeria and a fisheries consultant from Britain. One scheduled passenger from Greece missed the flight by minutes.The plane: Boeing is faced with crisis. At least 23 airlines, largely in China, removed from service the Boeing model, the 737 Max 8, involved in this crash and a similar one five months ago, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia that killed 189 people. In the U.S., the Association of Flight Attendants urged the Federal Aviation Administration to review the model, 350 of which have been delivered around the world.Max 8 jets typically make more than 8,500 flights per week. These are the airlines that fly them.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain flew to Strasbourg, France, to try to rescue her unpopular withdrawal plan from the E.U. She secured new legal pledges, but it was unclear whether the concessions from the E.U. would be enough to prevent another defeat of her deal in Parliament today. What next? If her plan is again defeated, Mrs. May has promised to offer a vote on whether Britain should leave the E.U. without a deal — a situation that could brutally upend Britain’s economy and one that a majority of lawmakers oppose. If they decide against that, they would then be allowed a vote on whether Britain should request an extension of its negotiations with Brussels.If Mrs. May can limit the size of any defeat today, she might even be able to hold a third, final vote on her plan just before the scheduled departure from the E.U. on March 29. Related: A protest by customs officers in France has delayed Eurostar trains and backed up trucks for miles, providing Britain with a taste of a post-Brexit world.  Labour Party: The British opposition party, which is losing both Remain and Leave voters while facing serious accusations of institutional anti-Semitism, is in crisis.The country’s electric system has been down for five days, plunging most of Venezuela into sporadic darkness and threatening social collapse.Food is spoiling in a country with not enough of it. Looting and protests have broken out, and desperate patients have been begging doctors to be kept alive. Since Venezuela’s largest power producer went down on Thursday, no date has been set to restart the plant — the source of 80 percent of the country’s electricity. Finger-pointing: President Nicolás Maduro blames U.S. sabotage and cyberattacks for the blackout, without providing evidence. Energy experts and Venezuelan power sector contractors dismissed that explanation, instead citing mismanagement and corruption.Other developments: The Treasury Department penalized a Moscow-based bank that it accused of helping Mr. Maduro’s government evade American sanctions. A few hours later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a sarcasm-laced speech accusing Cuba and Russia of propping up Mr. Maduro. On Tuesday, he announced the removal of all American diplomatic personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Caracas because of worsening conditions in the country. Raheem Sterling, one of the finest English players of his generation, has become part of the global conversation about racial equality led by athletes like Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James. After a fan screamed a racial obscenity at him at a Premier League match in December, Sterling responded with a pointed Instagram post. In an interview with our reporter, he expanded on themes of racial abuse and racist tropes the British news media uses to describe him.“It is a stereotype of black people: chains and jewelry, bling and money,” he said. “I just wanted people to pause and think.”Afghanistan: As the Taliban’s peace talks with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar, entered an extraordinary third week, the group pressed its offensive in a western province, killing 16 Afghan National Army soldiers and capturing 40 — an entire company.U.S.-China trade war: In high-stakes negotiations with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s strategy of relying heavily on his own personality and ability to read people failed. The same strategy faces a serious test with China’s president, Xi Jinping.Turkey: The country is officially entering a recession, with government figures showing two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth. The currency has tumbled and investor concerns are rising, a damaging combination for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of crucial elections at the end of the month.Algeria: Yielding to weeks of protest in the tightly controlled country, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 82-year-old ailing president who has ruled for 20 years, announced that he would not seek a fifth term in office — but he also canceled the election scheduled for April, raising questions about how long he would remain in power.U.S. budget: The record $4.75 trillion proposal President Trump sent to lawmakers has no chance of passage. Instead, our Washington reporters write, it serves as a declaration of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign priorities: $8.6 billion for the construction of a border wall, a 5 percent increase in military spending and deep cuts to domestic programs.Tesla: Days after its chief executive, Elon Musk, announced that the carmaker would shut most of its dealerships, Tesla reversed course, saying it would keep “significantly more stores open” and raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide.Super bloom: Forest fires followed by heavy rains in California this year have spurred colorful wildflowers to blossom across the state, turning arid landscapes into explosions of purples, yellows and greens.The internet: The memes, Wikipedia pages and emails that you look at every day travel to your device via nearly 750,000 miles of extremely thin cables strung across the ocean floor.

" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day. By Penn Bullock(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Knife crime on the rise in Britain, a new strategy at Facebook and the sordid market for Hitler paintings. Here’s the latest: Knife crime is rising for the fourth straight year in Britain — there were 43,000 such offenses in the year ending Sept. 30, 2018 — though over all it has declined markedly since the mid-1990s. Two recent fatal stabbings of 17-year-olds have refocused national attention on the problem and created a political crisis for Prime Minister Theresa May. The opposition Labour Party is blaming austerity for the rise in knife crime, and Mrs. May’s own home secretary, Sajid Javid, has clashed with her, demanding emergency increases in police funding.Analysis: There are more than 20,000 fewer police officers today than in 2010, and many now spend hours doing the work once done by mental health agencies that have been cut back or eliminated. But analysts largely agree that the data does not connect rising crime to diminished police presence. Instead, they point to austerity cuts to social services, like youth centers and interventions for children who are expelled from school. Looking ahead: Mrs. May said she would hold a summit in the coming days and meet with victims.The U.S. imported more goods than ever last year, bringing its trade deficit with the rest of the world to $891.3 billion.President Trump has long been fixated on narrowing the trade deficit, which he believes is a measure of whether other countries are taking advantage of the U.S. Though few economists share that view, the new figures suggest that by his own metric, Mr. Trump is failing.Reasons: The increase in the amount of imported goods was driven in part by a broader economic slowdown and the strength of the U.S. dollar, both of which weakened global demand for American exports. The U.S. imported a record amount of goods from China, despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. American exports to China fell nearly 50 percent in December. U.S.-Europe trade talks: Negotiators are deeply at odds. The Trump administration has insisted that any deal must address American farmers’ access to the European market, but the E.U. says agriculture had always been off the table by agreement. The competing narratives have made it difficult to even begin talks, with Mr. Trump dangling the possibility of further tariffs in mid-May.  After years of scandals surrounding user privacy, the world’s largest social network will prioritize private and encrypted communication between users, shifting away from its founding principles of public sharing and an open platform.“I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today’s open platforms,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said in a blog post.Details: Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to spend the years ahead building systems and products that create a type of “digital living room” where people can communicate privately across all of the company’s networks — Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. He was vague on how long that would take or how private, encrypted communications would affect Facebook’s bottom line. In other business news: Tesla is shutting down most of its stores — just three months after a sprint to open new locations — in an effort to cut costs at a time when investor confidence in the company and its founder, Elon Musk, is wavering.In the last 10 years, experts say, a seedy niche market has grown around rising demand for art by Hitler. With experts in no rush to offer authentication, and his undistinguished style easy to copy, fraud appears to have flourished. Now German prosecutors are stepping in. Last month, they searched Weidler’s auction house in Nuremberg and confiscated scores of paintings as part of an investigation into forgery and fraud, and there was an earlier raid at the Kloss auction house in Berlin. An auction by Weidler’s of a few works recently went ahead anyway, and our reporter attended. Background: With 63 works impounded and an estimated 100 already sold, Weidler’s has handled a curiously large number of “A. Hitler” works, experts say, especially given how few are likely to exist. Hitler did most of his painting before World War I, after he was rejected from art school. Once in power, he ordered the works collected, and he may have destroyed some of the worst misfires. North Korea: The country’s deepening economic trouble may propel it to return to the negotiating table, experts say — or resume weapons tests to force a deal. Sexual assault: Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona and the first woman in the Air Force to fly in combat, told a hushed Senate hearing room that she had been sexually assaulted multiple times while serving her country.Brazil: As millions of Brazilians enjoyed the last few hours of Carnival, Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right president, posted a video on Twitter of one man urinating on another in public, which he called evidence of the festivities’ increasing debauchery.Solomon Islands: An oil spill in the South Pacific is spreading just outside a World Heritage site, threatening the coral reef ecosystems there. Iran: The lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh had defended women arrested for defying Iran’s head-covering rule. Now Ms. Sotudeh, 55, has been convicted of security-related crimes in a secret trial and could face a “very lengthy sentence,” a human rights group reported.Italy: To the frustration of U.S. and E.U. officials, the country appears poised to accept Chinese infrastructure investment that is part of a drive to advance China’s global interests and influence. Carlos Ghosn: The former Nissan chairman has been released on bail, a relatively rare feat in Japan, but he faces steep odds in his trial on charges of financial misconduct: Japanese prosecutors have a 99 percent conviction rate with indicted defendants.Virgin Atlantic: The British airline said that female flight attendants would no longer have to wear makeup or skirts.Ireland: Thanks to a tip, the police in Dublin recovered a mummified head believed to belong to an 800-year-old Crusader knight. A week earlier, it had been stolen from a medieval church crypt in the city. Switzerland: The star of the Geneva International Motor Show this week is a one-of-a-kind Bugatti supercar that has already sold for $19 million, reputedly the highest price ever paid for a new automobile. Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Match sweet, tangy citrus with peanuts and avocado for a satisfying salad.Tours by and for women have grown in popularity. From a polar bear cruise in Norway to a cultural retreat in Calgary, here are four destinations to consider.Lighting, textiles, throw pillows and smells: There are ways to style a room on a budget; all you really need is a bit of imagination and patience.If you’re about to open a can of something tasty, thank the French. And the British.In the late 1700s, Napoleon was on the move, invading Italy, Austria and Egypt. Feeding his enormous armies was a problem — he needed a way to keep food from spoiling.A confectioner, Nicolas Appert, spent years coming up with a successful process. He placed fruits, vegetables and meats in glass bottles, corked and wired them, then boiled the bottles for hours. He didn’t know he was killing microbes — he just knew that the more heat and less air, the better.By 1810, Napoleon’s government handed him a 12,000-franc prize and required him to publish a book, with the catchy title “The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances for Many Years.”Glass, unfortunately, breaks.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)A fight has broken out between TPG and Bill McGlashan, the senior executive caught up in a huge college bribery scandal, over how he left the $103 billion investment giant, Michael de la Merced of DealBook reports.Mr. McGlashan had initially been put on leave by TPG after being accused of collaborating with William Singer, who ran the college preparatory business at the center of the scandal. Prosecutors say that Mr. Singer advised the financier to claim that his son had learning disabilities, and that Mr. McGlashan paid $50,000 to Mr. Singer’s charity.TPG said it fired him for cause yesterday. “We believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization,” the firm said in a statement.TPG told employees and partners that it learned about the accusations against Mr. McGlashan only after prosecutors unsealed their case, according to an internal note reviewed by DealBook.But Mr. McGlashan said that he had already resigned. “I am deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which I have devoted my life,” he wrote in a note.Emails between Mr. McGlashan and top TPG executives, provided by his spokesman, appear to confirm that. Mr. McGlashan emailed his resignation at 1:02 p.m. yesterday, according to the correspondence. At 2:03 p.m., Jon Winkelried, one of TPG’s co-C.E.O.s, replied, acknowledging receipt of the resignation — but he also included a notice of termination.At 2:20 p.m., Mr. McGlashan responded, “I am perplexed by your attempt to terminate me because, as you acknowledged in your email, you had already received my resignation.”It’s unclear what is at stake financially for Mr. McGlashan in terms of his TPG severance. In his email, Mr. Winkelried wrote to Mr. McGlashan, “We will be in touch to advise you of the economic consequences of the termination of your employment.”A spokesman for TPG declined to comment on the emails.More: The man who tipped off authorities to the college admissions scandal was reportedly a financier who was being investigated in a securities fraud case. And here’s a reminder why paying bribes to get your child into college is a federal crime.Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would pivot toward privacy. With two of the company’s top executives leaving just days later, it appears the change has had an immediate impact.The two executives — Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, who is widely regarded as the company’s No. 3, and Chris Daniels, the head of WhatsApp — announced yesterday that they were to leave the company. Their departure comes “after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network’s future direction,” according to Mike Isaac of the NYT.“The differences stemmed from Mr. Zuckerberg’s asserting control over his company and its apps — Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger — by rolling out a plan to integrate the services into a single privacy-focused platform, according to six people involved in the situation,” he adds.Several executives at Facebook feared that knitting together the apps could take a toll on the popularity and growth of their individual products, according to Mr. Isaac. They were also reportedly worried that they could lose autonomy and power. Traces of those sentiments could be seen in a public statement issued by Mr. Cox.“Facebook has become Zuckerberg’s company now more than ever,” Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. “Whether that’s good for the company or for the company’s billions of users — we’ll see.”In the wake of two fatal crashes within five months that involved its 737 Max airplanes, the company is reeling.Boeing will suspend delivery of its 737 Max jets, it announced yesterday, but continue to produce them. It currently builds 52 aircraft a month, many of which are Max models, and entirely shutting down production would prove costly.But the policy may only last so long. Boeing’s production facility in Renton, Wash., has only limited capacity for storing the airplanes, according to the WSJ. Boeing may, however, be able to apply for special permits to fly the planes to other storage sites, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, big questions hang over the Max’s software. Pilots from Southwest Airlines and American Airlines requested software updates for some of the 737 Max’s automated systems last year, reports the NYT. They were promised updates within six weeks, one pilot said, but they have still not arrived. Similarities between the two recent crashes point to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.And the U.S. Air Force has also lost trust in Boeing. In a case unrelated to the Max debacle, Air Force officials said that quality control issues with a new aerial refueling tanker caused it to suspend deliveries in February.British lawmakers yesterday voted to postpone the country’s departure from the E.U., but narrowly failed to wrest control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, write Ellen Barry and Stephen Castle of the NYT.“Mrs. May fended off — by just two votes — a remarkable power grab by lawmakers frustrated at months of political deadlock that has left the country in limbo with just 15 days to go before its scheduled departure from the bloc. They later voted by 412 to 202 for a motion that means that Britain will almost certainly not leave the E.U. as scheduled on March 29.”“What remains unclear now is how long the delay will be. Mrs. May plans to hold a third vote on her unpopular plan for withdrawal, despite have suffered two staggering defeats on it already. If the prime minister should succeed in a third attempt, she would then request a short delay — no more than three months — from E.U. leaders.”“But the motion noted that should her plan go down to defeat once again, Mrs. May might have to ask European leaders for a much longer delay, with unknown consequences.”More: Brexit’s importance to the global economy may have been overstated.Tulane’s Corporate Law Institute, a conference held every spring in New Orleans, is where the mergers-and-acquisitions world gathers to talk shop. Usually, it’s about how good business is — but a sense of unease has intruded this year’s festivities, Michael de la Merced of DealBook reports.Bankers and lawyers should be celebrating. Last year’s $4.2 trillion in global announced deals was the third-best year ever, according to Citigroup. Nearly every industry enjoyed a rise in deal-making.And M. & A. should keep rolling on. Mark Shafir, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup, and others at the conference noted that takeover financing remains cheap, shareholders seem to support sensible deals and shareholder activists are continuing to push companies into transactions.But “there is no doubt that we are in a much less bullish environment for M. & A. than a year ago,” Mr. Shafir said. Among the pressures on deal-making:• There are fears about a potential recession, the ongoing trade wars and the persistent worry that the stock market will suffer like it did late last year.• Regulators are a big issue too, especially the concern that they could be used as political cudgels. One of the big topics at the conference was the growing importance of overseers like Cfius, the American government panel that reviews cross-border deals for national security concerns.• And then there’s the natural cycle of deal-making. Booms tend to be followed by big drops in volumes, and this cycle has gone on longer than most, Mr. Shafir said.The Connecticut Supreme Court cleared the way for a lawsuit against the companies that manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Rick Rojas and Kristin Hussey of the NYT report.The ruling allows a case, brought by victims’ families, to go around the immunity that Congress granted gun companies to shield them from litigation when their weapons are used in a crime. That leaves open the potential for Remington, which made the rifle used in the attack, to be held liable.Lawyers for the families argued that advertising campaigns for guns appeared to be “courting” troubled young men, like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook shooting. In a 4-3 ruling, justices “found that the sweeping federal protections did not prevent the families from bringing a lawsuit based on wrongful marketing claims,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey write.“The decision represents a significant development in the long-running battle between gun control advocates and the gun lobby,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey add. And it could chart a “possible legal road map for victims’ relatives and survivors from other mass shootings.”President Trump appears to have reeled in his claim on Wednesday of being “not in a rush whatsoever” to reach a trade deal with China.“We’ll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we’re going to know over the next three to four weeks,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to CNBC. He added that China had been “very responsible and very reasonable.”Such optimism may have been helped along by the news that China made “last-minute changes to a proposed foreign-investment law,” in an attempt to “address U.S. complaints about forced technology transfer,” according to the WSJ. Intellectual property concerns have been a major part of the trade dispute between America and China.But a final agreement is still some way off.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday that a proposed meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China won’t happen this month because there is still more work to do. Sources tell Bloomberg it could happen in April.Elon Musk last night unveiled a new seven-seat compact sport-utility vehicle called the Model Y, Neal E. Boudette and Raymond Zhong of the NYT write:• “The Model Y will be available beginning next year, the company said, at prices ranging from $39,000 to $60,000, depending on the model, with a $2,500 deposit.”• “A long-range version will be able to drive 300 miles on a single charge, it said, while the $60,000 Performance model will have a top speed of 150 miles per hour.”• “‘It has the functionality of an S.U.V., but it will ride like a sports car,’ Mr. Musk said. ‘This thing will be really tight in corners.’”The unveiling “comes as Tesla confronts sales challenges,” Mr. Boudette and Mr. Zhong write. Sales of the Model S and Model X have been flattening, and its push to sell the Model 3 for $35,000 remains shrouded in uncertainty as the company works out how to cut costs to make that pricing possible.Andrew Weissmann, one of Robert Mueller’s top deputies, is said to be leaving the special counsel’s office.Lee Fixel, a partner at Tiger Global Management, is leaving the hedge fund in June.The meat-substitute start-up Impossible Foods hired Dennis Woodside, who was Dropbox’s C.O.O., as its president.Tesla named Vaibhav Taneja as its new chief accounting officer.Goldman Sachs plans to cut 65 jobs because of “economic” factors.Deals• Uber reportedly plans to publicly disclose its I.P.O. prospectus in April.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Riley Newman, a former head of data science at Airbnb, set out in mid-2017 to raise a venture capital fund that would invest in a multitude of tech trends.But he quickly realized that potential investors were not interested in that kind of fund. Instead, all they wanted to hear about were his former Airbnb colleagues and whether they might start their own companies.“It was, ‘Yeah, all that stuff is fine, but Airbnb, right?’” Mr. Newman, 36, said. “Airbnb was where we had a competitive edge on the market.”So Mr. Newman and his partners at Wave Capital adjusted their pitch: They said they were creating a fund to invest specifically in Airbnb employees who were planning to leave the company to become entrepreneurs. It worked. He and his partners quickly secured $55 million and now are preparing to make a flood of investments after the $31 billion home rental start-up goes public sometime in the next year and employees cash out their shares.“We know they are planning to start companies,” Mr. Newman said of Airbnb employees, adding that in the last week alone he had heard from four who left to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.Everyone else in Silicon Valley seems to know it, too. As Lyft, Pinterest, Postmates, Slack and Uber — among some of this decade’s most prominent start-ups — get ready to list on the stock market, investors are preparing to write checks to a new generation of companies created by their workers.It’s part of Silicon Valley’s often-incestuous circle of life. The start-up world projects a meritocratic image, but in reality, it is a small, tightknit club where success typically hinges on whom you know.In this model, employees of tech start-ups frequently leave the companies once they have been enriched by their firms’ initial public offerings. Then networks of alumni from these companies — called mafias — support their peers’ new businesses with hiring, advice and money.The cycle goes back to at least the 1950s, when Fairchild Semiconductor, one of Silicon Valley’s earliest successes, was started by a group of disgruntled Shockley Semiconductor employees called the Traitorous Eight.Decades later, early employees of PayPal, known as the PayPal Mafia, are more famous for their successes after leaving the company — many of which they collaborated on with one another — than for their initial breakthrough in digital payments. The group includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, as well as the creators of YouTube, Yelp and LinkedIn.Silicon Valley is now anticipating new mafias connected to Uber, Airbnb and their brethren after the companies go public.“It’s going to trigger a massive explosion in entrepreneurship,” said Howard Lindzon, an entrepreneur in Phoenix who invests in five to 10 venture capital funds a year. He said he particularly wanted to put money into funds with connections to the Uber and Airbnb networks.Venture capital firms are already hiring former employees from Uber and other I.P.O.-ready companies to get a foothold in their networks. Some of the fiercest recruiting has been of Uber executives, with venture firms including Sequoia Capital, GV, Javelin Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures all adding former employees from the ride-hailing firm to their ranks.One recruit was Andrew Chen, who worked at Uber as head of rider growth and left the company last year. He has since joined the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner and hosts quarterly dinners for Uber alumni turned founders.Mr. Chen, 36, estimates that two dozen venture-backed start-ups have come out of Uber so far. Andreessen Horowitz has recently invested in two, which have not been announced.“Those are the prime start-up investing opportunities,” Mr. Chen said.The problem is that venture firms might create a brain drain from the likes of Airbnb and Uber if they keep luring the companies’ workers to start new companies. Talent, after all, is a precious commodity in Silicon Valley.Jonathan Golden, who worked as a director of product at Airbnb and who joined the venture firm NEA last year, said Airbnb was fine with his plans to invest in former employees. He said he had discussed his intentions with Airbnb’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, before he left the company in 2017.“I’m not actively trying to have people leave Airbnb,” Mr. Golden said. “But if someone is going to leave, I want to be supportive of them, and Brian is supportive of them as well.”Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said, “We’re always sad when talented people move on, but it’s been great to watch so many of our former colleagues succeed.”Uber declined to comment.In February, Annie Kadavy, a former Uber executive who is now a venture capitalist at Redpoint, announced an investment in Ike, a self-driving truck company created by — who else? — ex-Uber employees.Ms. Kadavy, 33, who left Uber last year, said her network of former ride-hailing colleagues would help her find and vet deals. In addition, it would help find talent to bring to other start-ups that Redpoint has invested in.“If you’re a person leaving a company, who are you going to ask about what company to join next?” she said. “Your friend who works at a venture firm, because their job is to have a point of view on a bunch of different businesses.”In February 2018, Dan Hill and Michelle Rittenhouse, longtime Airbnb employees, felt the entrepreneurial itch and quit. They had a general idea to start a company that would make it easier for people to donate to charity, but not much else.The details didn’t matter to Wave Capital, which wanted to invest in them. “These are people we know can build great products,” said Mr. Newman. “They know us, they trust us. We know them, we trust them.”Within a few weeks of leaving Airbnb, Mr. Hill and Ms. Rittenhouse had secured $2 million — including from Wave Capital — for Alma, their newly formed company focused on philanthropy.Entrepreneurs typically make dozens of pitches over several months to raise financing. But Mr. Hill said the relatively quick fund-raising for his start-up was not a surprise.“We already had a strong relationship,” he said. “So when we pitched the idea for Alma and our initial plans, it was an easier conversation.”It’s a common story among former employees of hot start-ups. Andrew Chapin, who previously worked at Uber, also said it wasn’t hard to round up $3.75 million last October for Basis, his new mental health start-up, thanks to his reputation among the Uber crowd.“When you look at V.C., there is a lot of pattern matching and trying to act on that, so if you worked at Uber, you must be O.K.,” Mr. Chapin, 31, said. “I didn’t have to do a lot of pitching.”It helps that many of his former colleagues are now millionaires, having cashed out their shares in private stock sales.A syndicate of several hundred former Uber employees are even investing in start-ups together. Josh Mohrer and William Barnes, early Uber employees who left in 2017, said they used a private email list to manage the syndicate’s deal selection, adding a few new people to the list each week as they “graduate” from the company. The group has backed around a dozen start-ups at a pace of around one a month, they said.To stay on top of all the new companies emerging from Uber, Mr. Mohrer and Mr. Barnes said, they have organized reunions of former employees in cities around the world, using a Facebook group with more than 1,000 members.The pair also plan to raise an investment fund dedicated to backing Uber alumni under the banner of Moving Capital, according to three people familiar with the project, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are private.How will Silicon Valley’s new mafias be different from those in the past?The Uber and Airbnb networks are part of a generation that pioneered the on-demand “gig economy” and everything that came with it. That means many fought real-world policy issues in cities, as opposed to primarily dealing with the digital world.“There are just not that many places to find people who have seen that kind of scale,” said Ryan Graves, Uber’s former senior vice president of global operations and a member of the company’s board.Each city that Uber, Airbnb, Lyft or Postmates expanded into created a new set of operational, regulatory and business challenges. Regulators balked. Rival business operators resisted. Neighbors protested. And people abused the platforms, over and over.Uber managers ran each city like a mini-start-up. “If you were the general manager of San Francisco or of Atlanta, you were the C.E.O. of your region,” Mr. Chen said. “It led to a really entrepreneurial approach from everyone.”The thorniest challenge for Uber alumni may be showing that they have learned from the company’s ugly 2017, when its toxic culture of harassment, discrimination and ethical lapses was exposed.Blaine Light, a former Uber employee, said he had taken the importance of creating an inclusive culture to heart. Half of the employees at Qwick, a 20-person start-up in Phoenix that he joined as a co-founder in 2018, are women, and the staff includes a mix of races, backgrounds and sexual orientations. Mr. Light said he emphasized a culture of humility.“Uber people, in general, are looking to take what we’ve learned and make something better this time,” he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of one of Wave Capital’s partners.

" AdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump’s impending political war, China’s aggressive ambitions in Africa, and Nissan’s unexpected popularity in Britain. Here’s the latest: The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival “that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison,” writes our chief White House correspondent.News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.And The Washington Post reported that the president had taken extensive steps to conceal his conversations with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin over the past two years.Congress: Democrats in the House will, on Tuesday, grill former Attorney General William Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Next month, they’ll question Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The response: Mr. Trump attacked the F.B.I. and its former top officials on Twitter over news of the investigation and denied The Post’s report.The partial shutdown is now the longest ever gap in American government funding, surpassing the previous record of 21 days under the Clinton administration in 1995.President Trump is still digging in on his demand for money for a wall at the southern border, though he has backed away from declaring a national emergency. House Democrats refuse to accede.Impact: Here’s a visual look at the shutdown’s far-reaching consequences for the 800,000 federal workers who are going without pay.The roots: Decisions made in the 1970s helped lay the groundwork for today’s dysfunction.Another angle: The British Parliament is all but certain to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan on Tuesday, leaving the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. mired in uncertainty. Our journalists examine how the crises afflicting two venerable, historic democracies can impact the whole world. China’s investments in Africa are central to President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road initiative. The Trump administration sees it as an aggressive debt-trap scheme aimed at extending Beijing’s political influence around the world.Case study: In 2016, an American consortium of oil and gas executives from General Electric put in a bid to build a $4 billion oil refinery in Uganda that could be the largest in East Africa. It faced long odds against the competition, two Chinese energy companies with deep pockets, Beijing’s support and significant pull with the Ugandan government.Why it matters: The Ugandan case demonstrates the difficulties western governments face as they try to push back against China. In October, the Trump administration set aside $60 billion in financing for global projects — though that is still a fraction of what Beijing has pledged to spend.In Kabul, Afghanistan, dozens of boys are held at a juvenile detention center as national security threats, charged with planting, carrying or making bombs and trying to become suicide bombers.The Times, which was granted exclusive access to the prison a few months ago, found that many bear deep cuts and bruises — some self-inflicted, others from the bombs they are said to have detonated. None admit the full range of the crimes they’re accused of.“The Taliban made me fight for them,” said one. “The local police beat me to force me to confess,” said another.The problem: So far, counseling the boys to steer them away from extremism hasn’t seemed to work. So what are the authorities to do with them at the end of their sentences, when their added years could enable them to cause worse mayhem?

" Virgin Hyperloop One is testing a system that would put passengers in pods hurtling through vacuum tubes. Other companies are moving ahead with similar plans.The tube used for unmanned testing by Virgin Hyperloop One north of Las Vegas. The system aims to move people and cargo through tubes in wheel-less pods. CreditCreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesSupported byBy Eric A. TaubMOAPA, Nev. — California just decided to sharply scale back its plans for a high-speed rail artery meant to transform travel up and down the state. But in the desert outside Las Vegas, the transportation ambitions still seem limitless.Here, engineers working for Virgin Hyperloop One are testing a radically different type of mass transit: one that aims to move people and cargo in small wheel-less pods in a vacuum tube at speeds that could exceed 600 miles per hour. Today’s swiftest rail travel, at top speeds less than half as fast, would become a quaint anachronism.The company, which counts Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group as a minority investor, is one of several in the United States, Canada and other countries developing hyperloop technology. The concept was promoted by Elon Musk, of electric-car and private-rocket renown, and then offered by one of his companies as open-source technology available to all. It works by propelling pods using magnetic levitation through a low-pressure, near-vacuum tube.The low pressure minimizes friction and air resistance, greatly reducing the power needed. And because the pods travel in a tube, they’re not subject to shutdowns due to harsh weather, like snow or polar vortexes.We’ve seen this concept before. Libraries used to send book requests to the stacks in pneumatic tubes. Until 1984, a similar network whisked messages around Paris. And a series of underground tubes once dispatched mail between Manhattan and Brooklyn.The concept was even tried with people for three years in New York’s subway. Beginning in 1870, Beach Pneumatic Transit, named for its developer, ran a passenger capsule moved by pneumatic power under Broadway in Manhattan, from Warren Street to Murray Street.Virgin Hyperloop One, based in Los Angeles, began testing here in 2017 and is now doing so with a full-scale test track; its main competitors, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, also in Los Angeles, and TransPod, with headquarters in Toronto, expect to build their own test tracks this year. So far both are working with computer simulations.In the barren desert 35 miles north of the Las Vegas Strip, Virgin’s 1,640-foot-long, 11-foot-high tube has been used for hundreds of runs, with an empty pod that in one test accelerated to 240 m.p.h. Plans call for the commercialized system to reach a continuous 510 m.p.h., with 670 m.p.h. possible.To avoid making anyone sick, the system would take three minutes to accelerate to that speed, and the train would need to travel six miles to turn 90 degrees, said Ismaeel Babur, one of the company’s senior civil engineers.Because of its slow takeoff rate, “you’ll feel 30 to 40 percent of the acceleration compared to an airplane,” Mr. Babur said. The trip will be so smooth, he added, that “coffee won’t slide even at 600 miles per hour.”Each of the three companies has raised tens to hundreds of millions of dollars and developed its own patented approach to long-distance mass transit. TransPod, with $52 million in capital, has preliminary agreements to build a six-mile test track for a route that would eventually span the 180 miles between Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, as well as a shorter track near Limoges, France, for one of several French routes under consideration.Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, which has raised $42 million, is in the design phase for a 1,100-yard test track in Abu Dhabi and is preparing to build a 350-yard test track in Toulouse, France.Virgin, which has raised $295 million, is in the developmental stage with projects in India and Ohio. Last month, the Indian state of Maharashtra declared the company’s proposed hyperloop system between Pune and Mumbai as an official infrastructure project. Construction on a seven-mile test track could start this year, said Jay Walder, the company’s chief executive.Passenger operations could begin by the middle of the next decade, cutting travel time between the cities to 30 minutes, one-fifth the current duration.“The more we see, the more we find the technology to be compelling,” said William Murdock, executive director of the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission, a nonprofit governmental transportation agency. Virgin Hyperloop One is working on a proposed system to connect Chicago, Columbus and Pittsburgh.“Columbus is a freight logistics hub,” said Mr. Murdock, who hopes that the entire hyperloop route could be built in the next 10 years. “To commute quickly between Chicago and Pittsburgh would be fantastic.”All three companies contend that because of energy cost advantages over other forms of transportation, a system will be able to break even in a decade after full-scale operations begin. Not only will commuters be able to get from place to place faster, but doing so will allow people to comfortably live far from their work, giving access to educational, cultural and health services normally out of reach.Hyperloop developers expect pods to carry not only people but also high-value, low-weight cargo, offering an alternative to carriers using high-cost air transport, like FedEx and Amazon. In addition, they say, automobile manufacturers and others relying on just-in-time delivery of parts to keep inventory costs down would be able to get parts from distant locations.While such visions are a distant dream, hyperloop companies have attracted key talent and enthusiastic municipalities. Mr. Walder, Virgin Hyperloop One’s chief executive, is a former head of New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and managing director at Transport for London. Before taking the job in November, he said, he asked Mr. Branson — who stepped down as Virgin Hyperloop One’s chairman last year — whether he was “still fully committed to this.”“Not only was he committed, but he thought it was one of the most exciting things he’s ever done,” Mr. Walder said. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies is taking a more holistic approach, looking to reinvent not only transport but also the way companies work and the way such a venture can be sustainably funded.The company has only 50 full-time employees, but they’re augmented by 800 people around the world who work strictly for stock options, in exchange for putting in at least 10 hours per week on the project.“This model gives us a fairly low burn rate,” said Dirk Ahlborn, the company’s founder and chief executive. “But there are communication challenges. Some teams work amazingly, and others do not perform at all. You’re competing with their free time, their wives and their babies. It’s definitely a different way to do things.”Another difference from other transit systems will be the passenger experience. To keep the structural integrity of the near-vacuum tube, there will be no windows. “People would get sick looking at trees passing by at 600 miles per hour,” said Sébastien Gendron, TransPod’s chief executive.Instead, developers are looking at various exterior simulations that could be projected on large screens throughout the pod. “We could create a depth effect through video projection,” Mr. Gendron said. Even movies could be shown. Mr. Ahlborn believes that showing advertisements and providing other services to travelers could provide additional income that would hold down fares. “My vision is that the ticket model is not the best model,” he said. “We can enable a marketplace of services and generate a lot of money.”But before such musings turn into reality, hyperloop proponents must prove that their systems work, that they’re safe for people and cargo and that they’re affordable.“From the point of view of physics, hyperloop is doable,” said Garrett Reisman, professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California and a former astronaut on the International Space Station.The experience will be no different from riding in an airplane with the shades drawn, and technical issues around maintaining the vacuum within the tube will be solved, he believes.Instead, hyperloop projects will face more mundane challenges.“Getting innovative things through the regulatory and certification environments is very difficult,” Mr. Reisman said. “This could face an uphill battle in the U.S.” Which companies will succeed, if any, is anyone’s guess. Yet each main player is rooting for the others, knowing that one failure will put a pall over the technology as a whole.“The worst thing that would happen to us is if Virgin Hyperloop One is not successful,” Mr. Ahlborn said. Whether any company can garner the necessary finance is still an open question, leading Mr. Ahlborn to wonder if any one can ultimately go it alone. “Maybe there could be a consolidation between our companies,” he said.Rick Geddes, professor in the department of policy analysis and management at Cornell University, sees a different challenge. “The biggest problems for hyperloop will be securing rights of way and permitting,” he said.Still, Professor Geddes believes that hyperloop systems will become a reality, as the time is ripe.“There’s a sense that things are stale; we’re just adding to existing modes of transport,” he said. “Time is more and more a valuable commodity. The transportation industry is ready for a new way of thinking.”An earlier version of this article misstated the time needed for a Virgin Hyperloop One train to accelerate to 600 miles per hour and the distance of a 90-degree turn at that speed. According to the company, the acceleration would require three minutes, not 30, and the turn would cover six miles, not 42.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byBy Nellie BowlesSYDNEY, Australia — Atlassian is a very boring software company. It develops products for software engineers and project managers, with hits like Jira (for software project management and bug tracking) and Fisheye (a revision-control browser). And who could forget Confluence (an enterprise knowledge management system)?So why are its two founders household names in Australia?Because Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, both 39, are the country’s first start-up-to-I.P.O. tech billionaires. And because in the last year, they have started to make noise.Until recently, they largely stayed out of the public eye, even as Atlassian grew to become a $20 billion company. Now, as Australian politics tilt toward the right on global issues like immigration, cybersecurity and climate change, they are emerging as new political voices, getting in Twitter spats and lobbying Parliament.The other reason they are now household names: In 2017, Mr. Farquhar bought the most expensive home in Australia, a historic Sydney estate that sold for 73 million Australian dollars, or $52 million.In December, Mr. Cannon-Brookes broke that record when he closed on the house next door.I met the Atlassian founders for a few days in Sydney. Over brunches, a ferry ride and a birthday party, they told me about their new roles in public life, and what it feels like to be the first tech billionaires in a country where wealth usually comes from mining or banking.“People are interested now in what we’re saying,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said. “We have a voice. We have a sense of responsibility.”The two met as undergraduates at the University of New South Wales, where both were in a business scholarship program sponsored by Australian companies. They were encouraged to join one of those companies after graduating, but instead the two friends founded Atlassian, shocking their teachers and friends.It was 2002. Doing a start-up was unusual.“It was disbelief, really — why would you not go with a sponsor company?” said Christine Van Toorn, the program’s director and a lecturer at the school.They relied on credit cards for initial financing. They advertised by going to developer meetups, buying beer for the room and putting Atlassian stickers on the bottles.The company took off almost immediately.“Within three years we went from pariah to sponsoring the program ourselves,” Mr. Farquhar said.The products they created were cheap and easy to use. They sold by word of mouth (the company employs few sales representatives). But Silicon Valley paid them little mind. When their friend Didier Elzinga, founder of Culture Amp, was at a venture capital dinner in Palo Alto, Calif., an investor asked why people should care about Atlassian.“And I said, ‘O.K. Tell me a company in the Valley that listed with a $5 billion market cap and where the two founders own 75 percent,’” Mr. Elzinga said. “They didn’t need Silicon Valley.”First they confused Silicon Valley. And then they confused Australia.“The orthodoxy amongst the Australian tech companies is to stay away from politics,” said Alan Jones, the founder of M8 Ventures, an Australian venture capital firm. “And then now there’s these guys.”Their approach to policy is an extension of how they run a business together and live next door to each other: by relying on their differences.[Sign up for the Australia Letter to get news, conversation starters and local recommendations in your inbox each week.]Mr. Cannon-Brookes’s father was the chief executive of Citigroup Australia. His son wears his hair long, usually under a trucker hat. He has a shaggy beard and swears casually.Mr. Farquhar’s roots are more working class: His father worked at a service station, and his mother worked at McDonald’s. He is quieter, with close-cropped, sandy brown hair.He was recently upset that he hadn’t finished a marathon in under four hours (it was four hours and two minutes). When his green smoothie almost overflowed its glass (but didn’t), Mr. Farquhar immediately thought of lenses: “Positive meniscus!” he exclaimed.In their political activism, Mr. Cannon-Brookes is often the public face, posting on Twitter and talking to the news media, while Mr. Farquhar focuses on Canberra, the capital — where this week he caused a stir by condemning a new law under which tech companies can be forced to build tools that help law enforcement get around encryption in their products.“Sometimes we try the front door, sometimes we need to blow up the side door,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said of their political activities.Both became more interested in Australian politics after policies took a sharp turn toward the parochial, with the governing coalition abandoning efforts to address climate change and stoking fears around immigration.That presented a problem for a company that needs to hire talented engineers, often from abroad. And so initially, the founders’ main goal was basic: to make Australia more tech-friendly and its politicians more tech-aware.First, they hosted a coding class for elected officials and started working to get engineering into more curriculums.“It was like organizing the world’s worst wedding,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.Still, it earned them some respect. “They do some wonderfully creative things,” said Julie Bishop, who was deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 2007 to 2018. “Mike and Scott have an enormously influential role to play.”Australia just passed Switzerland as the richest country in the world as measured by household median wealth, and Mr. Cannon-Brookes thinks its reliance on mineral wealth has made the country slower to make tech investment or long-term economic change a priority.Mr. Cannon-Brookes is especially passionate about climate change. As Prime Minister Scott Morrison has walked back Australia’s renewable energy ambitions, Mr. Cannon-Brookes has become a staunch critic.“You’ve made me mad & inspired me,” he told the prime minister on Twitter, adding an expletive for emphasis.Along with goading Elon Musk to bring Australia the world’s largest battery to help solve its power problems, Mr. Cannon-Brookes has been gathering others in the Australian business community to push Canberra. Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, has told the Atlassian founders to “stick to their knitting.”“His knitting is running the country well, and he doesn’t seem to be doing it,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.He personally invests in alternative fuel and food sources, and he is especially interested in controlled-environment agriculture. “My wife and I have a big belief in the future of insects as a food source,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said over brunch (granola, not insects).Mr. Farquhar tends to focus on the issues aligned with Atlassian’s fortunes: cybersecurity (he says the new encryption law has cost the company customers) and immigration (he argues that the government is hurting recruitment and innovation by aiming to cut Australia’s immigration intake).It is not at all clear whether he can influence the encryption law; potential amendments are due to be debated in Parliament this week, and no changes are expected.But on immigration, Atlassian’s founders have moved the needle. After Australia’s skilled worker program cut several technology roles (including web developer) from its approved visa categories, Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Cannon-Brookes lobbied Parliament to change course and add more opportunities for international recruitment.On a ferry ride to work, Mr. Farquhar pointed out the two founders’ houses, huge estates set into the lush Sydney hillside. Before they bought the properties, plans had been made to tear down the houses and develop the lots.Mr. Cannon-Brookes and his family moved in a few weeks ago. He and Mr. Farquhar created a hole in the fence so their children could play together. One day a week, the founders pick up their children at school together and take the ferry home.“It’s a changing of the guard,” Mr. Farquhar said, referring to the houses. “They were owned by two newspaper families. It used to be newspaper dynasties, and now it’s technology dynasties.”It was a symbolically significant transition. The Fairfax family, a newspaper dynasty, had owned the properties since 1901.“It was an establishment family, a very conservative family, very committed members of the Congregational Church, and they were mainstays of Sydney’s exclusive eastern suburbs,” said Bridget Griffen-Foley, a professor of media at Macquarie University in Sydney. “So it’s quite symbolic that the fortunes of the old media dynasty have been so affected by digital disruption, and now you’ve got tech billionaires taking over.”This is a big change for Australia, where software entrepreneurs do not have the kind of cultural sway they have in the United States and elsewhere.“Most of the mansions owned by the neighbors are offshore billionaires or really old Australian money — mineral money, gold rush money,” said Mr. Jones, the venture capitalist. “It’s been 100 years since most of the families on Sydney Harbor made their money.”Money notwithstanding, running a growing tech company in Australia is a challenge, the founders said. Recruitment is hard. Two-thirds of Atlassian’s work force is in San Francisco.The founders have formed a cohort of friends with big tech companies outside Silicon Valley, including Daniel Ek, the Swedish chief executive of Spotify, and Ryan Smith of Qualtrics, who is based in Utah.“We’ve got all the same problems,” Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.And so every two years the Atlassian founders have hosted a private retreat, inviting every Australian start-up valued over $100 million, which is about a dozen. They hike and fish. Families are invited. The goal is to encourage camaraderie and share best practices.It is one of many reasons the two men say they would not leave Australia for Silicon Valley.“I know the U.S. very well, and I know Australia very well,” Mr. Farquhar said. “And I think we’ve got it better here.”Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Campbell RobertsonCLEVELAND — When things overheat, corrode and stop working, that is when they call in Gustavo Costa.It’s a rare expertise, critical to everything from space travel to fracking, and it keeps him in steady demand as a contractor at NASA’s John H. Glenn Research Center. It has also put Dr. Costa, a United States citizen since August, within reach of his ultimate dream: working directly for NASA, a government agency as well-known as Coca-Cola back in his little Brazilian hometown.These days, though, Dr. Costa does not make the five-mile trip from his house to the center. He is at home, already forced to consider jobs elsewhere because NASA has all but shut down for reasons that don’t seem to make much sense. Politics — even overheated, corroded, dysfunctional politics — are outside of Dr. Costa’s expertise.“What are they going to do next?” he asked on a cold morning in his quiet living room. “Do they realize what damage they’re causing?”The Civil Service relies to a large degree on good will. No matter how vital high-skilled federal workers are to the functioning of government, there are usually companies willing to offer them much higher salaries — double or even triple in some cases — on top of the free lunches and stock options. As student debt soars and private sector opportunities multiply, the sheer allure of public service — “the mission,” as NASA researchers often put it — is what keeps a lot of talent in the government.The longest shutdown in the country’s history is eroding that good will, already wearing thin after years of pay freezes, unpredictable budgets, and disdain from even the White House for government workers as swamp creatures or worse.Long after the government reopens, this is the damage that could last. If public service loses its allure, it will make it harder to recruit and hold onto the experienced and talented, those who can design spacecraft but also the people who battle epidemics, predict hurricanes and keep the food supply safe.Steve Reaves, a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee who leads the union for FEMA workers, said he knew firsthand of six experienced people who had left the agency since the shutdown began. Two went to BP, the oil giant.[Read more on how the shutdown is affecting federal workers in every state.]“They’re relying on the pure good intentions of the higher skilled work force,” said Matt Linton, a computer security specialist in California who worked for NASA’s Ames Research Center for 14 years. “And that’s what they drain down the most quickly in these stupid shutdowns.”This is a concern across federal agencies and departments — and even, strikingly, at NASA, the gold standard of government agencies, which seemed in the past to have no trouble attracting anyone with the right stuff.The essential pitch is spelled out in large metal letters at the entrance to the Glenn Research Center, a half-moon-shaped cluster of buildings just northwest of the Cleveland airport. “Research and technology,” it reads, “for the benefit of all.”In normal times, around 3,000 people are at work at Glenn, roughly half of them contractors and the other half civil servants, designing subsonic aeronautics or recreating the atmosphere of Venus. For the past few weeks it has been nearly empty.The workers at Glenn are mostly waiting, drawing down savings, wondering about the state of their untended lab work, reading about Chinese spacecraft landing on the moon and pondering the appeal of the public good when a good chunk of the public seems to have little use for it.“All these people seem to be celebrating our misfortune,” said Michael Kulis, a NASA chemist, who had seen comments on social media portraying federal workers as layabouts enjoying their vacations.Or, as one administration official said in an op-ed shared on Twitter by the president, the workers offered “nothing of external value” and were doing “errands for the sake of errands.”A Navy veteran who is the son of a police officer, Dr. Kulis is committed to staying at NASA, but finds all the scorn for public servants disheartening. “We didn’t get Ph.D.s just to sit around,” he said.As a place to work, NASA still measures up against the corporate world, where venture capital comes and goes, big contracts are lost, funders get impatient. Even SpaceX, Elon Musk’s private space travel company, recently announced it was laying off around 10 percent of its work force. There are pensions and benefits in government work, and there is job stability. Or at least there used to be.Recruiters and others at NASA say that even before the shutdown, the agency has not been the draw on top talent it once was. A graduate student interested in aerospace engineering is as likely to be wearing a SpaceX logo as the old blue-and-red NASA meatball.Interns come to Glenn, learn what they can and leave for Lockheed Martin, Pratt & Whitney or Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company.The shutdown is not making recruiting any easier. The already slim stipends for postdoctoral fellows, invited to spend their early careers at NASA, have run dry, leaving them at the mercy of online fund-raising. Jeffrey Severino, a college student from the Bronx who planned to spend his winter break developing algorithms on a paid internship at Glenn, spent it instead delivering takeout.“I still want to work for them,” he said of NASA, though he is now asking what he would do if a shutdown were to happen again.[Read more on federal workers taking odd jobs to make money during the shutdown.]Now, even scientists and engineers several years into their careers at NASA are talking of leaving before things get worse.“People have forgotten what public institutions do and the roles that they play,” said one young NASA research scientist, who dreamed of working at NASA as a child in a family of immigrants, and discovered a new planet before he got out of high school.The scientist, who did not want to give his name out of fear of political reprisal, spent much of the past year preparing for an ambitious climate-related project to start in early January, based on his own technology and involving aircraft, boats and an international team of scientists. The shutdown canceled it. He is now working as a Lyft driver to pay the bills, an arrangement that can keep him afloat for only a few more days.“I don’t want to give up on my country, but if you’re good at science and that’s what you do that’s what’s going to happen,” he said by phone on the way to a job interview. “There are opportunities in Canada that have a lot of great scientific potential.”Governments are among the few places with the money and the latitude for research into fundamental questions without immediate or obvious application.This is the kind of research rarely found on Wall Street or even Silicon Valley, where science is typically tied to the bottom line.“We can’t land humans on Mars, reverse climate change or cure cancer without it,” said Lee Stone, a NASA research scientist and a vice president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, a union that represents thousands in the government and private sector.When asked in an email about the shutdown’s effect on NASA, an agency spokeswoman, Katherine Brown, had an automatic reply that she was in furlough status and unable to respond.Mr. Linton, the California computer security specialist, had considered himself “a lifer” at NASA. “I felt like my job meant something,” he said.But in the fall of 2013, Congress could not agree about a budget amid a Republican crusade to defund the Affordable Care Act. So, to his astonishment, the government shut down for two weeks.He was the only one in his section deemed essential, which meant coming to the center for four hours a day. The rest of the time he was free to think: about the needs of his young family and about the message sent by a government that deems thousands of its employees not valuable enough to do their jobs.A Silicon Valley firm emailed him, asking him to visit in his spare time. He went, learned he could be making double his salary and shortly after the shutdown ended, left government for good.“Before 2013,” Mr. Linton said, “you at least felt like the whole country was behind you when you said, ‘I work for NASA.’ Now it’s absolutely evident that only 40 or 50 percent of the country is behind you and the other 40 or 50 percent think you’re some sort of fiscal drain.”The current shutdown, he said, was proof that he was right to leave when he did.His old colleagues at NASA now see that, too. He has been getting emails from them over the past few weeks, he said. They are asking for references.Advertisement"
" AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)The catastrophic fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris yesterday badly damaged the 850-year-old building, but some of France’s richest moguls are stepping up to pay for repairs.Around 500 firefighters battled the blaze for nearly five hours, Adam Nossiter and Aurelian Breeden of the NYT write. By 11 p.m. Paris time, the structure had been “saved and preserved as a whole,” the city’s fire chief, Jean-Claude Gallet, said. But two-thirds of the roof was destroyed and the main spire collapsed. So far, it’s unclear both how the fire started and how much survives of the interior, but nobody was killed or injured, officials said.“We will rebuild Notre-Dame,” President Emmanuel Macron said last night. “Because that is what the French expect.”So far 300 million euros, or $339 million, have been pledged for rebuilding, Bloomberg reports:• François-Henri Pinault, the C.E.O. of the luxury goods conglomerate Kering, and his father, François Pinault, will donate €100 million from their investment company, Artemis.• The Arnault family, which runs the rival luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, responded with a pledge of €200 million, plus its architectural and design resources.If you want to donate, Fast Company explains three ways.More: An algorithmic error by YouTube served up information about the Sept. 11 attacks alongside live video of the fire.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________Two House committees demanded documents about President Trump’s finances from Deutsche Bank, his longtime lender, yesterday.It’s the latest effort to gain insight into Mr. Trump’s financial records, as the president resists demands for access to his tax returns and other documents.Lawmakers also subpoenaed records from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup related to potential money-laundering in Russia and Eastern Europe, the NYT reports.“The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern,” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.Deutsche Bank says it’s cooperating. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations,” a spokeswoman for the firm said.But the Trump Organization condemned the moves. Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump’s sons, called the subpoenas “an unprecedented abuse of power.” A lawyer for the company said it was considering options for preventing Deutsche Bank from complying.More: Two Pulitzer Prizes were awarded yesterday to reports investigating Mr. Trump’s finances. The NYT won for its investigation into how the Trump family avoided paying a half-billion dollars in taxes, while the WSJ was recognized for revealing hush-money payments made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump.This year promises to be one of the biggest for public offerings in recent memory. And that’s created a scheduling problem, Erin Griffith and Michael de la Merced of the NYT report.If all the big tech I.P.O. candidates went to market, they could issue over $100 billion in new stock, according to Renaissance Capital. At the peak of the dot-com era, in 2000, the figure was $96 billion.I.P.O.s are already running into each other. Pinterest wanted to go public before Good Friday — and wound up scheduling its offering on Thursday, the day also chosen by the video conferencing company Zoom. Uber ensured that there were at least 30 days between Lyft’s prospectus filing and its own.“I do think there’s going to be some potential indigestion,” Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital told the NYT. Barrett Daniels of Deloitte added, “There could end up being I.P.O. fatigue because it is going to be overwhelming.”Uber is a special concern. Its offering is expected to to be the biggest in years, raising $10 billion — which bankers working on rival offerings fear will suck the air out of the markets that week. They’re giving it a wide berth.Perfect timing could be important, because some bankers worry that a single bad debut could taint the batch. Lyft’s shares popped straight after their I.P.O., but two weeks later they’re down 22 percent. We’ll see if that is destined to hurt other unicorns when Pinterest goes public this week.France and Belgium refused to support a new round of trade negotiations between the European Union and the U.S. yesterday, suggesting a bumpy road ahead for those discussions.It’s a striking break in European unity. Trade measures normally pass unanimously. The European Commission had initially proposed a new round of trade talks in January.French and Belgian officials cited climate change, and specifically the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, as an objection.But the talks are expected to proceed anyway, with a focus on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods, excluding agricultural products, and making it easier for U.S. and E.U. companies to meet the other side’s technical requirements.Expect agriculture to be a point of contention. Congress and Mr. Trump both say it has to be addressed; but Cecilia Malmstrom, the E.U.’s chief negotiator, has called it “a red line for Europe.”U.S. companies are disclosing the pay ratio between bosses and median workers in proxy filings for the first full year since the S.E.C. demanded the metric. The FT and Equilar, a compensation consultancy, dug into the numbers, looking at the 100 largest companies by revenue that had published 2018 data by April 1, the midpoint of the annual reporting calendar. Three notable findings:• “Of the 100 CEOs, 11 made more than 1,000 times as much as their median employee.”• “Elon Musk was paid 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker,” though that company was not part of Equilar’s analysis.• “Warren Buffett earned less than seven times as much as the median Berkshire Hathaway employee.”Skepticism remains about the usefulness of the metric. It might cause a day or two’s bad publicity, critics say, but it will have much less effect on companies’ compensation decisions than their financial results.German prosecutors filed aggravated fraud charges yesterday against Martin Winterkorn, who was Volkswagen’s C.E.O. when it deceived regulators about emissions levels, Christopher Schuetze of the NYT writes.• “The charges are the first criminal indictment in Germany against an individual in connection with the diesel scandal.”• The indictment “includes charges of breach of trust, tax evasion and false certification, either directly or by aiding in such crimes. If convicted, Mr. Winterkorn could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.”• “In charging Mr. Winterkorn and four Volkswagen managers whose names were not released, the public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig tied the five to events reaching as far back as 2006.”• “The timeline is significant because it rejects initial claims by Volkswagen that senior management became aware of the so-called defeat devices used to cheat emissions tests only after being confronted by the United States environmental authorities in 2015.”• “Even after paying $33 billion in fines and settlements related to the scandal, the carmaker continues to face legal challenges and investigations from authorities in the United States and Germany.”Best Buy named Corie Barry, its chief financial officer, as its next C.E.O. The current C.E.O., Hubert Joly, will become executive chairman.The P.R. firm Prosek Partners plans to announce this morning that it has hired David Wells, who most recently led marketing and communications for Goldman Sachs’s consumer and investment management division, as a partner.Daniel Daniel, a former senior investor at BlackRock, has left to start Twenty Acre Global, an investment firm that will take stakes in tech companies.BlackRock has reportedly moved to hire Tang Xiaodong, most recently a senior executive at GF Securities, to oversee its mainland China operations.Deals• AT&T sold its 9.5 percent stake in Hulu back to the streaming service at a $15 billion valuation.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.The Justice Department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the Chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets, evade economic sanctions on Iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior.The context: The charges come as officials from Beijing and Washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the Trump administration tries to shoulder Huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China’s industry and information technology ministry called them “unfair and immoral.”The allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington’s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been “significant movement” on talks that involved “very complicated issues,” including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices. Yesterday, the chip maker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in China.As Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division, notes:“The damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump’s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.”The five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of it permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.That’s nearly double the $5.7 billion President Trump is seeking for a southern border wall — a project he still wants and is still threatening to shut down the government to get.The damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay, but with the government only funded for three weeks, many federal employees plan to hold off on spending.Here’s another wrinkle: Government statisticians just now returning to work are behind on collecting and analyzing figures on retail sales, manufacturing data, housing statistics and other information. Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump’s chances for re-election.“Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,” Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the “guts” to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called “childish.” Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: “Don’t help elect Trump,” yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, “Health care is a human right.”More: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz’s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Carlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request. His predicament has turned a spotlight on the Japanese criminal justice system, writes the NYT’s Motoko Rich:The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.Some in the West have reacted strongly to the power that prosecutors have wielded. “This is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,” one critic wrote.BlackBerry named Bryan Palma, a senior vice president at Cisco, as its chief operating officer and president. (MarketWatch)Deals• Unilever acquired the Laundress, a New York-based line of premium cleaning products, as it tries to bolster its high-end home care products. (Reuters)• Edward Lampert, the Sears chairman, says his bid for the retailer will make the company competitive and profitable again, but experts say there’s more to it. (CNN)• Two House panels will hold a joint hearing on Feb. 13 on the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.

(NYT)• The special counsel Robert Mueller is close to finishing his investigation, Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, announced in a highly unusual confirmation of the state of the inquiry. (NYT)• The Trump administration imposed economic penalties on Venezuela, a punitive step to add to the pressure on President Nicolás Maduro to resign.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The digital pin board company disclosed today that its I.P.O. would value it at less than its last private fund-raising round. That’s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year.The high range of Pinterest’s I.P.O. would value it at $11.3 billion, below the $12 billion attained from private investors two years ago. In Silicon Valley speak, that’s a “down round” — something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence.Coupled with early volatility in Lyft’s first days of trading, the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start-ups, especially given that many won’t turn a profit for years.It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public, including Uber (whose I.P.O. was expected to give a valuation as high as $120 billion), the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty.But there’s some reason not to panic yet. After initially falling below their I.P.O. price, Lyft shares bounced back. Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds: For instance, the file-sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I.P.O. And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show.More I.P.O. news: Though many investors are betting against Lyft’s newly public stock, the high-profile short seller Andrew Left isn’t among them. The Bridgewater Associates founder argued last week that capitalism “needs to be reformed.” Now he has outlined how he would do it:Declare the wealth and opportunity gaps a national emergency. “I have a principle that you will not effect change unless you affect the people who have their hands on the levers of power so that they move them to change things the way you want them to change,” he writes.Devise clear metrics for success. “I’d bring that sort of accountability down to the individual level to encourage an accountability culture in which individuals are aware of whether they are net contributors or net detractors to the society, and the individuals and the society make attempts to make them net contributors.”Redistribute resources to eliminate disparities. Mr. Dalio’s personal recommendations include:• Creating private-public partnerships that would vet and invest in projects that produce both social and economic returns.• Raise taxes on pollution and other causes of bad health.• Impose targeted tax increases on the wealthiest to pay for social welfare programs to bolster economic productivity.Better coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, so that more money ends up in the hands of people who will spend it (the lower and middle classes) as opposed to saving it (the wealthy).The British government has proposed sweeping new powers to regulate harmful content and false information, recommending one of the world’s most aggressive actions to police the internet, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.• A regulator would be given the power to “issue fines, block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms.”• Terrorism, inciting violence, encouraging suicide, spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address. The rules would apply to social media platforms, discussion forums, messaging services and search engines.• Facebook and Twitter will work with the government, representatives from the companies said.“Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet. Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication,” Mr. Satariano writes. But governments have become more willing to intervene “as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real-life consequences by contributing to violence, compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies.”“In the United States, where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations, there’s been less momentum to regulate internet content,” Mr. Satariano adds. But even in America, there is increasing support for new rules.President Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore — two vocal supporters of his policies — to the Federal Reserve board. Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank. Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would mean.Historically, Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussions.Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain wouldn’t change much at first. They’d hold two of 12 votes on the Fed’s Open Market Committee, so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilities.But over time, the Fed could lose credibility. “The United States’ role as the global reserve currency — which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight — is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades,” Mr. Irwin writes.The financial world is watching closely. “I think it’s a very big benefit to the U.S. economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed, and I hope that continues,” Ed Keon, the chief investment strategist at QMA, told CNBC.Nissan shareholders voted today to remove their former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from the board altogether, the WSJ reports.• “Much of the meeting was devoted to questions from angry shareholders, with many demanding Nissan executives step down for failing to find alleged wrongdoing.”• “In response to a shareholder who accused Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa of failing to take responsibility for any of the alleged wrongdoing, Mr. Saikawa said: ‘I never said we didn’t have responsibility. The problem built up over 20 years, and we cannot correct it overnight.’ ”Mr. Ghosn will be replaced by Renault’s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard. Greg Kelly, who is accused of abetting inaccurate disclosure of Mr. Ghosn’s compensation, was also voted off the board.More: Mr. Ghosn’s wife has appealed to the French government to help her husband.Prime Minister Theresa May sought to rekindle cross-party talks about her Brexit deal yesterday, just days before Britain is due to leave the E.U. without a deal, Benjamin Mueller of the NYT reports:• Mrs. May is seeking a way to persuade members of the opposition Labour Party to back her deal.• But Labour leaders maintained on Sunday “that Mrs. May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal.”• “And whatever overtures she makes to Labour, analysts said, she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal — a major sticking point in the cross-party talks.”Mrs. May will try to get another extension from Brussels this week. What such a delay would look like is undecided: Mrs. May wants a simple extension, while the European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, wants something more flexible. Either way, it will require the support of all 27 E.U. leaders at a summit meeting on Wednesday.If she doesn’t get an extension, Britain may crash out of the E.U. without a deal — or remain in the political bloc.Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as the secretary of homeland security yesterday. She’ll be replaced in the interim by Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.Warren Buffett urged Wells Fargo, in which he owns a nearly 10 percent stake, to avoid picking a Wall Street veteran as its next C.E.O.Amazon has reportedly hired Rajeev Badyal, SpaceX’s former vice president of satellites, to lead its new satellite internet program.The Wing, the women-focused co-working company, has hired Rachel Racusen from Snap as its vice president of communications.Kathe Sackler and Mortimer D.A.

" AdvertisementSupported byBy Chris Stanford(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with the latest round in the Trump-Pelosi feud, uncounted family separations at the border, and a contentious verdict in a case involving the Chicago police. And it’s Friday, so there’s a new news quiz.The capital now “resembles nothing so much as an unruly sandbox,” one of our White House correspondents writes. “As the shutdown drags on, septuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds.”On Thursday, a day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked President Trump to delay his State of the Union address, he denied her access to a military plane for a congressional visit to American troops in Afghanistan. “Obviously,” he said in a letter, flying commercial remained an option.Mr. Trump also canceled plans to send a U.S. delegation to Davos, Switzerland, next week for the World Economic Forum.The impact: The partial government shutdown is in its 28th day, and federal courts are running out of money. They’re expected to be able to continue funded operations through at least next Friday. The Trump administration most likely separated thousands more migrant children from their parents at the southwestern border than was previously believed, according to a government report released on Thursday.The federal government has reported that nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from their parents last year under the “zero tolerance” immigration policy. But inspectors from the Department of Health and Human Services found that there was no coordinated tracking system, meaning the total number is “unknown.”Catch up: The separations were a crucial part of the administration’s effort to deter migrant families, many fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, from trying to enter the U.S.President Trump on Thursday endorsed an updated effort to detect and intercept missiles bound for the U.S., evoking Ronald Reagan’s 1983 “Star Wars” program.Details released by the Pentagon suggested something more incremental, aimed largely at destroying small numbers of missiles launched by regional powers, rather than overwhelming strikes from Russia or China.Go deeper: The U.S. has spent more than $300 billion on antimissile projects over the decades, according to one expert. Our video explains the projects’ unimpressive rate of success.Another angle: In his speech on Thursday, the president did not mention the threat from North Korea, long a focus of missile-defense advocates. A North Korean envoy is in Washington today, as part of an effort to set up a second summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader.Three police officers were acquitted on Thursday of charges that they had conspired and lied to protect a white officer who fatally shot a black teenager in 2014. Officer Jason Van Dyke, who was convicted in October of the second-degree murder of Laquan McDonald, is to be sentenced today.Background: While in view of a police dashboard camera, Mr. Van Dyke fired 16 shots at Laquan, who was holding a knife. The shooting prompted citywide protests, the firing of Chicago’s police chief and a federal investigation.Geneticists have begun using bones to make sweeping claims about the distant past. But their revisions are making some scholars of prehistory uneasy. That’s partly because some stories sound like the Nazis’ claims of a superior race, but they also play into science’s real-world rivalries. Tesla job cuts: The automaker is reducing its full-time work force by 7 percent as it tries to lower the cost of making its Model 3 sedan, the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, told employees today.Deadly attack in Colombia: At least 21 people were killed and 68 wounded when a car bomb exploded outside a police academy in Bogotá on Thursday. It had been years since such an attack in the city, which was once terrorized by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.Los Angeles teachers’ strike: The city’s school superintendent and the president of the teachers’ union met face-to-face on Thursday for the first time since the walkout began in the country’s second-largest public school system. But negotiations still appeared to be at an impasse.Brexit deadlock is extended: Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain must return to Parliament on Monday with a Plan B for pulling the country from the European Union, after lawmakers soundly rejected her original proposal this week. A vote on the alternative isn’t expected until Jan. 29, two months before the scheduled withdrawal.L train shutdown: Two weeks after Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered a last-minute solution to avert a major New York City subway disruption, it’s unclear when construction will begin or how long it will last. Critics have also raised safety concerns. Snapshot: Above, bullet trains at a maintenance facility in Guangzhou, China, today before next month’s Lunar New Year celebrations and the accompanying travel rush.In memoriam: Mary Oliver, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, used plain language and minute attention to write about the natural world. She earned wide popularity, and comparisons to Walt Whitman and Robert Frost, although critical reaction was mixed. She died on Thursday at 83.N.F.L. playoff predictions: If our reporter is right about Sunday’s games, you’ll see the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl in a couple of weeks.News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.Late-night comedy: After a rapper made a rare venture into politics on Instagram, Trevor Noah said: “How cool would it be if Cardi B. somehow ended the shutdown?”What we’re listening to: This clip of a speech by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., recommended by Lynda Richardson, an editor in Travel. “Ahead of the national holiday honoring the assassinated civil rights leader, here he is observing that ‘Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic.’”Cook: Cauliflower rice steps in easily for normal rice. Roast it so the edges caramelize.

It suggested similarities between Sunday’s crash in Ethiopia and one involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia in October. Boeing’s C.E.O. said the company was “supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution.”The cost to Boeing could be huge. Airlines have “begun to demand compensation for their losses during the grounding,” Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT writes. And one analyst estimated that the company may have to spend nearly $1 billion to resolve issues with the 737 Max fleet. It could also face lawsuits from the families of passengers who died in the disasters.“But the bigger financial unknown is whether airlines lose confidence in the Max,” Ms. Kitroeff adds. If that happens, orders for the 737 Max — the company’s best-selling jet — could dry up, handing an advantage to Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, which makes a similar plane, the A320neo. But outright cancellations of orders seem unlikely, because airlines typically put down large deposits.The British Parliament voted last night to oppose the prospect of Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. without an agreement with the bloc, writes Stephen Castle of the NYT.“The vote was another harsh blow” to Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Castle writes. “A critical part of her strategy has been to play for time and use the fast-approaching threat of a chaotic, disorderly and economically damaging exit as leverage.”“Mrs. May said that if lawmakers can support a deal in the next few days, she could request a Brexit delay until June 30 to put it in place,” he adds. “But that appears unlikely. Parliament rejected the agreement she negotiated with the European Union in a humiliating 432 to 202 vote in January, and defeated it again on Tuesday, 391 to 242.”“Without an approved agreement, a longer extension would be needed, forcing Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. That suggests Mrs. May might make one more effort to get her unpopular plan through Parliament, threatening hard-line Brexit supporters that, if it fails, she will seek a long delay that could, potentially, mean Brexit never happening.”Brookfield Asset Management announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of Oaktree Capital Management for about $4.8 billion, creating an alternative asset manager giant that will rival the likes of Blackstone.Brookfield and Oaktree would control $475 billion of assets under management, including debt, according to Reuters. Blackstone, the industry leader, has at least $650 billion including debt, according to a spokesman of the firm who spoke to the news agency.“The deal is a bet by Brookfield, which currently focuses on private equity, real estate, infrastructure and renewable power, on the prospects for investing in debt, which makes up around 70 percent of Oaktree’s assets under management,” Reuters adds.The purchase is “the latest sign of how Toronto-based Brookfield has quietly come to dominate the alternative asset management industry,” according to the FT.Just one day after the White House’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said that a result from trade talks with China would be agreed “before too long,” President Trump undermined his efforts.“I’m not in a rush whatsoever,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to Bloomberg. The WSJ reports that Mr. Trump said that President Xi Jinping of China knows that the U.S. would walk away from a poor deal, and that he said, “China very much wants to make a deal.”This could be a negotiating tactic. “Trump can use this for leverage and could also be mindful he would be criticized for a weak deal,” Christopher Adams, a former official in the Treasury Department and U.S. trade negotiator in Beijing, told the WSJ.But it suggests there will be no deal in March. Mr. Trump spoke in February of a possible summit meeting at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, with Mr. Xi this month to sign an agreement. But unidentified officials told the WSJ that an April date now looks more likely.More: President Trump’s former economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the podcast “Freakonomics” that Mr. Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, is in his view the only Ph.D.-holding economist in the world who thinks that tariffs do not hurt the economy. The former C.E.O. of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, still hasn’t officially decided whether to enter the 2020 presidential race. But during a speech at Miami Dade College yesterday, designed to drum up support for such a bid, Mr. Schultz did outline what his independent presidency might offer. WaPo reports his remarks:• “I would not sign any legislation — none — into law that does not have bipartisan support. … We need to be candid with the American people and admit, yes, that both sides have good ideas if we work together.”• “The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders. … These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.”• “I will do everything I can to fight for the center, where the vast majority of Americans stand.”A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent smartphone and device makers that had entered into partnerships with Facebook, gaining access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of users, according to the NYT:“It is not clear when the grand jury inquiry, overseen by prosecutors with the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, began or exactly what it is focusing on.”“We are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.”“Facebook was already facing scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” And the Justice Department’s securities fraud unit started an investigation last year in the wake of the company’s Cambridge Analytica data scandal.Renault has removed Mouna Sepehri, an ally of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from her role as general secretary and placed her in advisory role. It is part of broader shake-up of the company’s senior management.At Mitsubishi, two other allies of Mr. Ghosn — Trevor Mann, the C.O.O., and Vincent Cobee, the head of product — have resigned.Aurora Cannabis hired Nelson Peltz, the founder of the activist hedge fund Trian Partners, as a strategic adviser.The U.S. Senate confirmed Neomi Rao to take Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s empty seat at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Deals• Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.High-level delegates from Beijing and Washington are meeting near the White House today for the first of two days of trade talks, but appear to have a great distance left to bridge.Each government has reason to play nice. Evidence is mounting that reciprocal tariffs are hurting both sides, and global markets have been skittish while awaiting a deal.But there are signs that China is unwilling to bend on key U.S. demands involving intellectual property and technology transfer, even as its lawmakers accelerated a vote on legislation addressing foreign investors’ concerns.A pair of indictments revealed earlier this week against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei could complicate the discussions, as could disagreements over strategy within the Trump administration’s team.Other factors include:Weakness in the Chinese economy. At least 20 companies reported yesterday that their 2018 earnings would fall short of expectations. The Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, Ford Motor’s primary partner in China, warned of a profit slump  of as much as 93 percent last year. China Life Insurance said its net income may have fallen as much as 70 percent. And Chinese exporters suffered a sluggish start to 2019.Slowing Chinese investment abroad. Net purchases of U.S. commercial real estate by Chinese companies — big buyers earlier in the decade — have slipped to their lowest level since 2012.Worries to the west. The motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said that tariffs — along with other shifts in its business — left it barely breaking even in the final quarter of 2018. In the European Union, there are concerns whatever happens: If China and the U.S. reach a deal, Mr. Trump might turn his attention to German cars and French wines. If not, China might dump discounted goods into the European market. “We are next in the queue,” said William De Vijlder, the chief economist at BNP Paribas.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Trump administration’s growth forecast is much rosier than those of economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, who warn that growth is slowing and put some of the blame on the government, writes the NYT’s Jim Tankersley.President Trump’s team has predicted that inflation-adjusted growth will average 3 percent through 2024. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Trump’s tax and trade policies were working as expected:“Last year looked just like we thought, so we don’t think, going into our next forecast, that there’s a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things.”An exceptional year: Growth appears to have exceeded 3 percent in 2018, the first time it has done so in a decade. But many economists attribute that to a burst of fiscal stimulus that isn’t expected to be repeated.Growing consensus: The Congressional Budget Office predicted that growth would slow to 2.3 percent this year and then to 1.7 percent in 2020. Economists at the Fed also forecast 2.3 percent growth this year. Some corporate financial executives are bracing for a recession.More Fed news: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has taken a conversational tone in public comments, but the markets didn’t understand. Investors face three outcomes if the Fed is done raising interest rates, and none of them are good.Apple reported yesterday that it had flat profit and lower revenue in the fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season. After years of expansion, the tech giant appears to be entering a period of vulnerability, writes the NYT’s Jack Nicas.Diminishing demand: The company has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, but they haven’t had the global impact of the iPhone. That was a drag on the company’s earnings.Slowdown in China: Apple is uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as to potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.Security concerns: Customers said a flaw in the iPhone let people eavesdrop on phone calls. The problem was in the FaceTime app, which Apple promised to fix by the end of the week, but it has been criticized for moving too slowly. A lawyer in Houston sued Apple over the glitch.More Apple news: Shares rallied after the company outlined plans for life beyond the iPhone. And it plans to lower prices on some phones outside U.S. to offset a strong dollar.Pacific Gas and Electric filed for a corporate reorganization on Tuesday that “is shaping up to be one of the most complicated and difficult in recent years,” writes Ivan Penn.Facing tens of billions of dollars in claims related to 17 major wildfires in California in 2017, with its equipment under investigation in several other blazes last year, PG&E decided to declare bankruptcy despite having a stable income stream and several offers of financing.Now creditors and suppliers of the state’s largest utility will face off against California officials and fire victims to be paid, while renewable energy companies and climate change activists jockey for position. Lawyers, bankers and consultants are likely to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.This is PG&E’s second bankruptcy in less than 20 years; the first came after California tried to deregulate utilities. Dan Reicher, who was an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration, called it “a real mess,” adding:“It comes down to lots of needs: Take care of the fire victims, keep the lights on, ensure progress on climate change and protect ratepayers. That’s at least a partial list.”Roger Lynch will step down as chief executive of Pandora, the company announced, after stockholders approved a $3.5 billion acquisition by SiriusXM.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here’s what to watch for. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)President Trump is optimistic about striking a trade deal with China — but Chinese officials are hesitant, according to Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson of the NYT:“Beijing officials are wary” that what currently looks like a positive trade deal for them, which doesn’t require big changes to the economy, could turn bad, Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson explain. They worry about “Mr. Trump’s propensity for last-minute changes,” according to unidentified sources.Those fears could derail a planned summit meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, where Mr. Trump hopes to sign a deal. “Persuading Mr. Xi to attend such a summit meeting is no easy task, given his imperative of appearing strong before a domestic audience,” Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson note.“The biggest barrier to a deal continues to be the enforcement of terms,” Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson add. “The United States has insisted that it retain the right to raise tariffs if China violates the agreement, without retaliation by Beijing. But some Chinese officials have criticized the arrangement as a potential infringement of China’s sovereign rights.”More: China exports and imports both fell in February, as an economic slowdown and trade fights weighed on the nation.The dust has settled on Mark Zuckerberg’s surprise announcement that the social network would refocus its business on privacy. Now, people are starting to dissect what, exactly, the news means for its business model.“Facebook is entering a transition phase where it will continue to sell targeted ads on its public social networks, while inventing a new business model,” Thomas Husson, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, told the FT. In other words, think of it as less of a pivot and as more of a diversification.So it will “still gather data from its existing sources,” Christopher Mims of the WSJ writes, “but also increasingly from messaging apps. These would double as interfaces with businesses and, eventually, usurp the functions of our credit cards and digital wallets.” Expect to see Facebook make announcements about payments, commerce and its own crypto token in the not-too-distant future.Diversification is a play for long-term survival, especially if regulators clamp down on the mass collection of data and targeted ads that have been the company’s bread and butter. The faster Facebook can spin up alternative revenue streams — and acting as a global payments network could be a lucrative one — the better its chances of continuing to grow.Bank of America released a report yesterday, on the eve of International Women’s Day, that shows the state of the global disparity in wealth between men and women. There’s reason for both hope and dismay, according to Ortenca Aliaj of the FT.The good:• The report says that improving women’s equality could raise global growth over the next six years by $28 trillion — or, as Ms. Aliaj writes, “roughly the same as the U.S. and China’s combined annual economic output.”• Women are expected to control $72 trillion of global financial assets by 2020, double what they held in 2010.The bad:• “The economic gender gap is closing at a ‘snail’s pace’ and it could take another 202 years to reach equality at the current rate.”• “Women in western Europe might start earning the same as men for the same roles in 60 years, while women in North America might have to wait another 165 years, the report calculated.”• “Data compiled from more than 10,000 respondents showed that men were more optimistic about higher pay rises over the next year while women expected to perform at least two and a half times more unpaid work than men.”More: The private equity and venture capital industries have $3 trillion in assets under management — but female entrepreneurs receive just a fraction of it, according to a new report.As Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, takes the U.S. government to court over a ban limiting the use of its products in federal agencies, the company has won the support of its government.• “We support relevant companies and individuals to take up legal weapons to safeguard their rights and interests, and not be silent lambs,” Wang Yi, Beijing’s top diplomat, said at a news conference yesterday.• “What we’re standing up for is not just the interests of a company, but also a country or nation’s legitimate right to innovate and by extension the basic right of all countries who wish to climb up the technology ladder,” he added.But Mr. Wang’s comments don’t address U.S. claims that Huawei equipment could be used by China to spy on American communications. As CNBC notes, Chinese law suggests that domestic companies are legally obligated to help the government with intelligence work — and may be forbidden from talking about it.With less than a week to go before Parliament makes a final vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, she is expected to try to shift the focus from Britain to the E.U.“Just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the E.U. has to make a choice too,” Mrs. May is expected to say in a speech today, according to the BBC. “It is in the European interest for the U.K. to leave with a deal.”“The decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote,” she will add, referring to her hope that European officials will make binding legal changes to the Irish border details of her deal. Those look necessary if Mrs. May is to win over lawmakers.Such a public plea for compromise shows how tough the negotiations have been. “Talks are expected to continue into the weekend,” Bloomberg notes. “If they fail, Parliament will likely vote against May’s deal for the second time, plunging the country into political chaos.”Just a few months ago, the European Central Bank put the brakes on a vast economic stimulus program. Yesterday, it unexpectedly reversed course, Jack Ewing of the NYT writes:• The E.C.B. voted unanimously “to bring back a stimulus measure intended to encourage lending. The move will help banks in countries with weaker economies like Italy that may have trouble raising money on capital markets at reasonable rates.”• “The bank also pushed back the date of its earliest possible increase in benchmark interest rates by at least four months.”• “The quick turnabout, from confidence to concern, reflects the broader weakness in the global economy. A slowdown in China, exacerbated by rising trade tensions with the United States, has reverberated around the world, dragging down growth in Europe and elsewhere.”• “Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, implicitly blamed White House policies for the economic damage behind the decision. ‘Lower confidence produced by the trade discussions’ was a key cause of economic slowdowns in Europe, China and emerging markets, Mr. Draghi said.”• “He added, though, that he did not expect a recession.”You might think that Martin Shkreli, the “pharma bro” imprisoned for fraud, would have curtailed his business efforts. You’d be wrong, as Rob Copeland and Bradley Hope of the WSJ point out.• “Wielding little more than a contraband smartphone, the disgraced pharmaceutical executive remains the shadow power at Phoenixus AG,” the company that, under a different name, drew outrage for jacking up the prices of rare drugs.• He conducts drug research from the prison’s computer lab and, until recently, tweeted insults at the likes of Jack Dorsey of Twitter.• His friends at a prison in Fort Dix, N.J., include inmates like “Krispy” and “D-Block.” (Their reported nickname for Mr. Shkreli is unprintable here.)• “A few weeks ago he rang up his handpicked chief executive during a safari vacation — to fire him, according to a person familiar with the exchange.” That was later changed to a suspension.• “His back-of-the-commissary-envelope calculation indicates that Phoenixus could be worth $3.7 billion by the time he is due to be freed in 2023, according to a person familiar with his thinking.” His business plan involves buying rare drugs and spending on research and development.• But minority shareholders in the company are tired of Mr. Shkreli’s behavior. “This investment is an absolute disaster,” Sabine Gritti, one of those investors, told the WSJ.Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Slack and a host of other Silicon Valley companies are poised to go public this year, making employees and investors who own shares very rich. Nellie Bowles of the NYT explores how they plan to spend their wealth:They will push up real estate prices. The Bay Area, known for its unaffordable housing, may get even pricier. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaries everywhere,’” Herman Chan, a real estate agent with Sotheby’s, told Ms. Bowles.There will be parties. Companies that go public want to celebrate, and hospitality companies are happy to oblige. One planner told Ms. Bowles that start-up I.P.O. party budgets can exceed $10 million, adding, “They’re wanting to bring in A-list celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives.”Trophy purchases will be made. But wealth advisers are trying to persuade new clients to show a little restraint. “I don’t think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturn,” Ryan S. Cole of Citrine Capital told the NYT, adding, “They shouldn’t be buying boats.”Jan Stahlberg, a co-founder of the Swedish private equity firm EQT, is leaving to start an impact-investing fund.Deals• Norway gave its sovereign wealth fund permission to sell off its holdings in pure-play oil companies.

Sign up here.)Aviation regulators will testify before Senate subcommittees today on the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 Jets, while Boeing meets with airline executives to update them on a fix for the software thought to be responsible for the accidents.The F.A.A.’s acting chief will defend the agency’s practice of delegating some plane safety checks to Boeing as “critical” to the success of the certification process. The official, Daniel Elwell, will argue that the process for the Max 8 was “detailed and thorough.”Senators are expected to ask about long-running doubts about the process. The NYT reports that F.A.A. employees and a Transportation Department watchdog worried over the years that the agency had “too close a relationship” with Boeing officials. Lawmakers will also ask why an update to the jet’s anti-stall software is still not ready.Boeing’s response to the crisis is also being questioned, particularly since its C.E.O., Dennis Muilenburg, has largely remained silent. “Their comments have been very engineering-esque,” Richard Levick, a communications expert, told the NYT. (The company’s public response has become more assertive since hiring the crisis communications firm Sard Verbinnen.)The company will meet today with 200 pilots and airline representatives at the factory where the Max 8 is made. It’s expected to offer some updates on the anti-stall software.More Boeing news: A Max 8 made an emergency landing in Orlando yesterday, though the incident is not thought to be connected to malfunctions that may have led to the two recent crashes.The European Parliament voted yesterday to pass a new copyright law requiring technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians, authors and news publishers in order to post their work online, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.“The new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively, rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting,” Mr. Satariano writes.The policy is deeply divisive. Digital rights activists and the tech industry say it could result in censorship. Media organizations say it should protect Europe’s creative industries and ensure companies pay for content they share online.Some digital business models could be affected, because website owners will take on more responsibility for what ends up on their platforms. Sites may find the law too expensive or cumbersome to police: Even Google shuttered its News service, which would require licenses from publishers under the new rules, when a similar initiative was introduced in Spain.Smaller organizations may be hit hardest. These websites contend that giant tech platforms already have the resources to comply with the law, Mr. Satariano writes.Purdue Pharma, the drug maker behind OxyContin, said yesterday that it will settle a lawsuit by Oklahoma’s attorney general over its role in the opioid crisis, Jan Hoffman of the NYT reports.Purdue and its owners will pay $270 million, far more than they have paid in previous settlements. The payout helps Purdue avoid a televised trial that was scheduled to begin on May 28.But many more legal battles await. A federal judge in Cleveland alone is overseeing a consolidated collection of 1,600 lawsuits, and 35 other states have sued Purdue as well.The settlement raises questions about a Purdue bankruptcy. The company has contemplated filing for Chapter 11 protection to help contain the cost of defending or settling its legal fights. In bankruptcy, lawsuit claimants would most likely get only a fraction of any court-determined payout.Chapter 11 weighed heavily in the Oklahoma case. The state made a bird-in-the-hand decision, and other plaintiffs may need to make a similar choice. “The concern is that counties and states may settle on the cheap early to avoid getting little to nothing later on,” Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, told the NYT.New data about Wall Street compensation shows that the financial sector’s huge pay has widened the national disparity between white men and women and people of color, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank.New York City’s financial sector bonus pool fell last year by 14 percent from the previous year, to $27.5 billion. But that is still three times bigger than the combined annual earnings of all U.S. full-time minimum-wage workers.A majority of financial workers are white men, especially at the top ranks, according to the institute. No less than 68 percent of senior managers at the five largest U.S. investment banks are white men.But they make up just 37 percent of America’s minimum-wage workers, who have full- or part-time jobs that pay $7.25 an hour. “Due to Washington inaction, the federal minimum wage continues to be a poverty wage, while the reckless bonus culture is alive and well on Wall Street,” the report concludes.As at least 80 patent fights between Apple and Qualcomm trickle through courts around the world, both companies scored victories yesterday, the WSJ reports.Some iPhones now face a U.S. import ban after an International Trade Commission judge issued an initial ruling yesterday finding that Apple had infringed a Qualcomm patent.But Apple scored a bigger victory when another I.T.C. judge ruled that the phone maker had not infringed a Qualcomm patent relating to power efficiency in mobile phones. That overturned a previous court finding.“Qualcomm is hoping a victory, particularly an import ban, could give it greater leverage in technology licensing negotiations,” Bloomberg explains. “Qualcomm says it’s due billions of dollars in unpaid royalties on the iPhone.”“Apple denied infringing any of the patents in the two cases and claimed Qualcomm is trying to shut its only U.S.-based competitor out of the market, something Apple argues will hinder the development of the fifth generation of mobile communications,” Bloomberg adds.Corporate America set a record for stock repurchases last year, even as lawmakers proposed curtailing the practice.Companies bought back $806.4 billion worth of their own shares, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with $223 billion of that coming in the fourth quarter alone. The previous high was $589.1 billion, set in 2007.The biggest buyer was Apple, which repurchased $101 billion of its stock.The buyback boom was fueled by the Trump tax cuts, with companies preferring to use their savings to repurchase shares and bolster their stock prices, rather than issue dividends or make new investments.And it came despite opposition from Congress, with lawmakers from Senator Bernie Sanders to Senator Marco Rubio arguing in favor of limits on the practice.But a repeat is unlikely this year, as the sugar rush from the tax cuts wears off.In 2013, Google started an ambitious and flashy effort to create robots under the control of Andy Rubin, who later left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment. Now, the company has overhauled the effort with more modest goals — but subtly advanced technology, Cade Metz of the NYT reports.Google’s first robot push was all about advanced machines, and was built on a series of acquisitions. Some of the companies that Google bought relied on humanoid robots, but the tech giant failed to capitalize on them, and sold off or shut down the companies over time.Now the focus is on making robots smarter by injecting them with machine-learning software. “The company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own, like sorting through a bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating a warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles,” Mr. Metz writes.“Google is tight-lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on,” Mr. Metz adds. That’s probably because most researchers see robots being used in warehouses and distribution centers around the world, raising questions about how automation will erode jobs.DealBook exclusive: The Brunswick Group plans to announce this morning that it has hired Michael O’Looney, most recently head of communications at Elliott Management, as a partner in New York and Courtney Chiang Dorman, who previously was the C.O.O. of the law firm Wilson Sonsini, as a partner in San Francisco.JC Penney hired Bill Wafford, most recently the chief financial officer of The Vitamin Shoppe, as its C.F.O.Simon Sutton is reportedly stepping down as HBO’s chief revenue officer.Deals• Lyft reportedly plans to raise the price range of its I.P.O. amid strong investor demand.

" China DailyAdvertisementShareAuthorities adopt policies to promote commercial space sector.Satellites have become the latest gold mine for private companies in China as they rush to reach for the stars in the space sector.The country’s satellite industry, which used to be dominated by State-owned enterprises, is gradually changing and opening to private players.A senior industry expert with a satellite startup in Beijing, who wished to remain anonymous, said that based on the startup’s internal research more than 90 Chinese startups that specialize in satellites or rockets have taken their first steps in the space industry in the past four years.“It means that on average, nearly two startups were founded every month in the past four years in China. It is significant if China is to grab a slice of the cake from the global competition in the budding space industry,” he said.According to The Space Report 2018 issued by The Space Foundation, the total market of the global space economy was $384 billion in 2017, a year-on-year increase of 7.4 percent. Of that, commercial activities accounted for more than 80 percent.Industry experts pointed out that China accounts for only 3 to 5 percent of the space economy globally, but the country is rapidly gaining ground in scale and in technology.Since 2014 Chinese authorities have adopted policies related to the country’s space industry, encouraging private players to take part.Earlier, the National Development and Reform Commission, along with the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, also unveiled a 10-year blueprint to promote the commercial space sector.In November LinkSure Network, a Chinese company that provides access to the internet free of charge, announced a plan to launch China’s first Wi-Fi satellite this year.It plans to send 272 satellites into space to provide free Wi-Fi globally by 2026. The first tranche of investment will be 3 billion yuan ($447 million).Similar to Elon Musk’s Starlink plan, the satellites will be used to expand internet coverage and boost internet speeds, the Shanghai-based internet firm said.“The starting point of such a plan is to offer free internet connections to people around the world, especially those in underdeveloped areas or rough terrain,” said Wang Xiaoshu, rotating president of LinkSure Network.The company, founded in 2013, became a unicorn－a startup valued at more than $1 billion－in 2015 by raising $52 million in its A-round of financing.“Satellite connection will be a great supplement to the ground network. The ground network, which relies on stations, has limitations due to, for example, weather and landform,” said An Yang, chief scientist of LinkSure’s satellite project.“On a global scale, the number of satellites is far from meeting the huge demand for communication. The future of the communication sector must be a combination of space and ground,” he said.Under the plan, revenue will come from services to high-end users as well as those provided to areas that the ground network is unable to reach, An said.LinkSure is not the first. A string of startups have sent satellites into space for different purposes. For instance, Guoxing Yuhang Co. Ltd., or ADA Space, a private firm based in Chengdu, Sichuan province, launched two artificial intelligence satellites at the end of last year.Though the country’s internet giants have not directly announced plans to develop, produce or launch satellites, they are showing a desire to do so.Tech conglomerate Alibaba Group launched a communication satellite to support its online shopping gala last year while Baidu CEO Robin Li said earlier that he hoped more support could be given to private companies in the civilian space segment.Another tech giant, Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also jumped on the bandwagon by investing in U.S. startup Moon Express, which was founded in 2013 by a group of space entrepreneurs.The U.S. startup is looking to profit from the commercial space sector through leveraging core technologies including using drones to mine asteroids.Compared with State-owned companies, private firms are better at commercialization including attracting and using money and resources, which will greatly improve efficiency, said Yang Feng, CEO of Spacety, a commercial aerospace company specializing in developing commercial micro and nano satellites.“It is also a promising area where State-owned and private space companies can supplement and cooperate with each other,” he added.Notably, some private players have also entered the overseas market. China Communication Technology Co. Ltd. in Shenzhen, a satellite-based communication services provider, has been beefing up its overseas presence to exploit foreign opportunities.“We aim to extend our business to Africa this year and will tap into one or two Belt and Road economies each year,” said Wu Guangsheng, president of CCT.CCT is currently offering services and products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and nine other countries and regions that are participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.In 2017, its overseas revenue was about 9 billion yuan, which made up more than 60 percent of the total.It also plans to further explore Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, and promote its products in Central Asian economies such as Kazakhstan.Last year, the company entered the Philippines by acquiring G Telecoms Inc., the third-biggest telecom operator in the local market.“In the past, we could only cooperate with local (telecom) carriers in foreign countries by selling our equipment to them. But with this big step, we can operate independently, be it launching our own satellites or providing data-related services,” Wu said.The business could have huge potential as some 75 percent of the Philippines’ 100 million population are aged 25 or under and they have a voracious demand for communication services.So far, CCT has received orders from civil aviation and public security departments in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.In 2018, at least 15 private space companies disclosed their financing with the total amount estimated to reach more than 2 billion yuan, according to a report from 36Kr, a science and technology media group.A report from China Money Network pointed out that seven private space companies had raised more than 1.66 billion yuan by August 2018.MatrixPartners China, IDG Capital, China Growth Capital and Shunwei Capital were among the major investors.Despite intensive capital support, industry insiders pointed out that there is still a long way to go for Chinese private firms to gain a lead.For startups, money is still the bottleneck, said Jiang Yunwei, president of CITIC Juxin (Beijing) Co. Ltd. Capital Management, in a report.“A company cannot earn money by launching a single satellite and the commercialization of satellites needs a network of dozens of satellites, which costs a lot,” he said.A satellite network requires at least 1.8 to 2 billion yuan, according to Xie Tao, founder and CEO of Beijing-based space startup Commsat Technology Development Co.Facing such pressure, satellite startups are expected to address another challenge－to reduce the cost of developing and launching satellites.“Companies should change their approach of using costly accessories made only for space,” said Xie. “Private companies can leverage commercial components to replace expensive ones.”Zhang Jiacheng, an investor in space startup OneSpace, agreed. “China is still at the starting point in the commercial space sector. A well-rounded system needs to be established to offer space startups affordable and sustainable services.”Cheng YuThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this advertisement’s creation."

Sign up here.Amazon yesterday canceled its plans to build a huge corporate campus in New York City.• The decision was an abrupt turnabout after a yearlong search for a second headquarters. The tech giant ultimately decided to open two new sites — in Queens and in Virginia. Each would have gained an estimated 25,000 jobs.• But Amazon faced a backlash in New York from lawmakers, activists and union leaders who said it didn’t deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.• “The company made its decision late Wednesday, after growing increasingly concerned that the backlash in New York showed no sign of abating and was tarnishing its image beyond the city,” J. David Goodman of the NYT writes.• “Looking at the opposition and the timeline we decided we don’t want to work in this environment in the long term,” Jodi Seth, the head of policy communications for Amazon, told NBC News.This could be a turning point for corporate-civic relations. It will surely change how companies think about doing business in certain states and cities. It’s also likely to make political leaders — especially in Democratic regions — reconsider offering tax incentives to lure business. (One big question here: Should states and cities be allowed to offer subsidies to business in the first place?)It’s also a clear sign that leftist views are gaining traction. The news is a short-term win for progressive politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are championing what they say are socialist messages. (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to revel in the decision on Twitter, saying that “anything is possible.”) But in the longer term, those lawmakers may face a backlash if the loss of those 25,000 jobs in Long Island City hurts the local economy.And it raises questions about the wider understanding of finance. “N.Y.C. wasn’t handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue,” Andrew tweeted. “There isn’t a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education.”More: The news came as a shock even to some of the labor groups that opposed the plans. Here’s what people are saying about the decision in New York City. Real-estate brokers are in despair. And tech could keep gaining ground in the city regardless.President Trump looks set to sign a bipartisan deal as soon as today to provide funding for border security and the federal government. But he’s also expected to declare a national emergency to get more money to build his long-promised border wall.Everything nearly fell apart yesterday. “The president was frustrated after a briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and others on details of the final deal to avoid a shutdown,” the WaPo reports, citing unnamed officials involved in the discussions. But assertions by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that the president had actually beaten Democrats helped sway Mr. Trump.By declaring a national emergency, Mr. Trump is hoping to gain access to billions more in federal funds. Combined with the spending bill and other ways of diverting money, he expects to get about $8 billion. (He originally asked for $5.7 billion from Congress.)There are huge concerns about the declaration. “Mr. Trump’s willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals,” Charlie Savage of the NYT writes.What next? House Democrats will probably try to terminate any declaration and the Senate may follow suit, Nicholas Fandos of the NYT writes. But Mr. Trump would veto that legislation, and it’s unlikely that Congress could override him. The White House could face legal battles over the declaration for years.The social network is in talks with the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations of privacy violations. It could lead to a record multibillion-dollar fine, Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes:• “The company and the F.T.C.’s consumer protection and enforcement staff have been in negotiations over a financial penalty for claims that Facebook violated a 2011 privacy consent decree with the agency.”• The investigation began shortly after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to light in March 2018.• “Some F.T.C. officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation. The agency can seek up to $41,000 for each violation found by the agency. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, 87 million people were affected.”• “The current talks have not yet reached the F.T.C.’s five commissioners for a vote and it is unclear how close the two sides are to wrapping up the nearly 11-month investigation.”More Facebook news: The social network reportedly uses its apps to track people that it believes are risks to its employees.Negotiators concluded talks today with no official announcement of an agreement, Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports. That leaves the state of the negotiations uncertain ahead of a deadline in two weeks.• “The two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the United States in a lengthy statement given to Chinese officials in May.”• Expectations for the talks were low, though some progress was made in the prelude to this week’s discussions. For example, China agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the World Trade Organization.• But big hurdles remained, Mr. Bradsher writes, including “the Trump administration’s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China’s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries.”• “The United States had given China a March 2 deadline toward reaching a deal and threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. But Mr. Trump suggested this week that he could give China more time if the talks showed progress.”• It’s unclear whether the talks went far enough for that extension to be granted.The British Prime Minister suffered an embarrassing defeat over Britain’s exit from the European Union last night, Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Her current plan lacks support. “By a margin of 303 to 258, lawmakers failed to support a motion endorsing the government’s battered strategy,” Mr. Castle writes, noting that “a fragile truce within her Conservative Party collapsed.”That could undermine her negotiations in Europe. “Mrs. May has assured European negotiators that she can get a majority for a revised Brexit plan, if they make some concessions,” Mr. Castle notes. But yesterday’s vote suggests that lawmakers still can’t coalesce around a single plan, leaving the E.U. with little incentive to budge.What now? British officials are “preparing to compromise on their demands for a rewrite of the Brexit agreement,” and may not ask the E.U. to reopen the existing withdrawal agreement, Bloomberg reports, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter.But she’s short on time. On Feb. 27, lawmakers are expected to try again to take control of the process out of Mrs. May’s hands. That gives her two weeks to develop a plan that Parliament likes. Given the lack of progress to date, that looks like a tall order.More Brexit news: Brussels rejected calls for dual-listed shares in London and the E.U. in the event of no deal. The New York Stock Exchange took the S.E.C. to court yesterday over a so-called Transaction Fee Pilot program that sorts listed stocks into categories with varying price controls. In a WSJ op-ed, Stacey Cunningham, the exchange’s president, explains why:• “The new rule amounts to an unnecessary exercise in government price-setting that will add a new layer of complexity to equity markets.”• “The Transaction Fee Pilot imposes government control on the incentives that public markets can offer. Market-maker benefits will be sharply reduced for some securities and fully eliminated for others.”• “The N.Y.S.E. voiced its concerns to the S.E.C. during its public-comment period. We argued that the pilot will undermine the ability of market forces to drive capital formation and will fail at its goal of measuring broker conflicts.”• “The S.E.C. freely admits it has no idea whether its pilot program will help or harm investors. This is a black flag that should worry the White House. The stock market is not a simulation. We operate in a real-world environment with investors’ real dollars.”David Bronczek will step down as FedEx’s president and as a director, weeks after joining its board.Tim Maly will retire as SurveyMonkey’s C.F.O. and C.O.O.The Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing reportedly plans to cut 15 percent of its work force, or about 2,000 people.Deals• Carl Icahn has reportedly taken a 10 percent stake in Caesars Entertainment and plans to push the casino operator to sell itself.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.President Trump might keep some tariffs on Chinese goods even if Beijing and Washington reach a trade agreement, he told the NYT yesterday, after delegates from both countries wrapped up another round of negotiations.“Without the tariffs, we wouldn’t be talking,” he said in an interview.How were the discussions? According to Mr. Trump’s posts on Twitter, they went well, “with good intent and spirit on both sides.” He hosted the negotiators in the Oval Office and suggested that President Xi Jinping of China was willing to welcome more American companies and to buy more American products — including five million tons of soybeans. The Chinese representatives, led by the American-educated vice premier, Liu He, said that the two sides had made “important progress” and had “candid, specific and fruitful” talks. Robert Lighthizer, the top American trade negotiator, was less sanguine. “We did not come off the rails,” he said. “That’s significant.”What’s next? The two sides hope to reach an agreement by early March, before Mr. Trump plans to increase tariffs after a 90-day truce. Mr. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will go to Beijing after the Chinese New Year holiday this month to prepare for  talks between the two presidents. Mr. Trump said that summit meeting would happen “in the near future” and that it would address “some of the long standing and more difficult points.” According to Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game.” He also used another sports analogy to describe the negotiations:I would now say we are at halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Facebook’s 35,000 employees got a reminder this week of Apple’s power over their day-to-day routines. So did workers at Google.After Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple’s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users’ consent. Apple eventually restored access for both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.The tension with Apple was not Facebook’s only concern.• The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be following the Russian playbook for using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.• Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target of several more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.Deutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it’s looking increasingly probable that the German government will step in to combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.Deutsche reported its first full-year net profit since 2014 today but still failed to meet analysts’ expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.The bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occur by midyear.But that may not be wise, writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:The deal looks like the option of last resort. Combining two of Europe’s most inefficient banks to create an even bigger supertanker would require tens of thousands of job cuts and a risky (read costly) integration to stand a chance of working.The Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there’s even more uncertainty than usual, writes the NYT’s Ben Casselman. Here’s what to look for:Crucial time: The United States’ decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.Potential impact: There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.Solid foundation: The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, and paychecks are growing.Investors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.Stiff competition: The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon’s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, as growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)Yesterday’s testimony by Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer, before the House Oversight Committee was full of theatrics. But between allegations of presidential lawbreaking and racism were revelations about how the Trump Organization operated. They weren’t flattering.Mr. Trump inflated his net worth to apply for bank loans, according to Mr. Cohen. When he asked Deutsche Bank for financing to buy the Buffalo Bills, he claimed to have $4 billion in unquantified “brand value.” He also exaggerated the value of properties, according to financial statements that Mr. Cohen gave to the House.Democratic lawmakers pushed Mr. Cohen to talk about other kinds of fraud. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, asked him whether Mr. Trump inflated the value of assets when insuring them. “Yes,” he replied.The testimony may have hurt Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Potential victims: Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s C.F.O., both of whom were said to have played a role in hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels; Ivanka Trump, who was involved in plans to build a tower in Moscow; and Jay Sekulow, a White House lawyer whom Mr. Cohen accused of altering testimony to Congress.Mr. Cohen hinted that more could be revealed. He told lawmakers that he couldn’t answer questions about his last conversation with the president because it was “being investigated right now” by federal prosecutors.Mr. Trump’s woes certainly aren’t over. Five House committees are investigating his business dealings, and federal prosecutors in New York are still looking at matters that involved Mr. Cohen.Robert Lighthizer, the president’s top trade adviser, warned lawmakers yesterday that hurdles remained to reaching a significant trade deal with China, Ana Swanson of the NYT reports:Plans to raise tariffs on Chinese goods are officially axed. Mr. Lighthizer, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed that the U.S. wouldn’t raise levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports after March 1.Mr. Lighthizer still plans to play hardball. He “told lawmakers that he and his negotiators are maintaining a tough line with the Chinese,” Ms. Swanson writes, “repeatedly using the word ‘if’ when talking about the potential for reaching a deal with Beijing.”And he insists that President Trump isn’t losing patience. “His instructions to me are: You have to get a great agreement. If we have no agreement, we’ll just wait until we can get a great agreement,” Mr. Lighthizer said.But success isn’t guaranteed. “Is this perfect? I’m not going to say it’s perfect,” Mr. Lighthizer said of the evolving deal. “But at least it’s leading to results where everything else didn’t.”More: The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened by 10 percent in December, despite the administration’s attempts to shrink it.The main topic at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, this week has been the long-hyped next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G, Adam Satariano of the NYT writes.The F.C.C.’s chairman says America is winning the race. “In my view we’re in the lead with respect to 5G,” the chairman, Ajit Pai, told the WSJ. He believes the agency is making progress in selling the necessary wireless spectrum and overhauling infrastructure.Not everyone agrees. Brent Skorup, who sits on the F.C.C.’s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee, writes in a WSJ op-ed that “the U.S. has stumbled,” but “still has time to catch and pass China, the current leader — if the right policies are put in place on both the local and federal levels.”“A widely available, reliable 5G network will require hundreds of thousands of new transmitter sites, and on that score the U.S. trails badly,” Mr. Skorup writes. Private industry will need to collaborate with the federal government, he cautions, adding that “with a combination of responsible use of public assets and light-touch regulation of 5G services, we can still win this race.”More: Here are all the 5G handsets announced so far.Today was supposed to bring a denuclearization deal between America and North Korea. Instead, officials abruptly cut short a summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “Sometimes you have to walk,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference today.Blame sanctions. Mr. Trump told reporters that North Korea wanted all of the punishing economic sanctions against the country lifted, but America wouldn’t cooperate unless Mr. Kim agreed to give up all of his nuclear weapons.The announcement was a surprise, in part because Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim appeared to be getting along well. At one point, Mr. Trump called his counterpart “my friend.”The collapse of the talks was “a diplomatic failure after he had hoped his second summit with Kim, following their meeting last summer in Singapore, would produce demonstrable progress toward North Korea’s denuclearization,” the WaPo reports. Mr. Trump insisted that the two countries could resume talks in the future.A week ago, the British prime minister was on the brink of resignations by cabinet officials and a crushing defeat in Parliament over her Brexit plan. Now, she has won another two weeks to tweak her agreement and convince lawmakers to back it.Mrs. May won a set of votes last night that had previously threatened to undermine her control of the Brexit process. The victory followed a partial surrender: She agreed on Tuesday to give Parliament the option of seeking to delay Britain’s exit from the E.U.“Theresa May is closer to leading Britain out of the European Union with a Brexit deal than at any other point since her negotiations with Brussels began,” Therese Raphael of Bloomberg Opinion writes. Hard-line Euroskeptic M.P.s like Jacob Rees-Mogg have softened their opposition to Mrs. May’s plans, fearing that the alternative might be remaining in the E.U.But her offer of a potential delay could fall apart. President Emmanuel Macron said France might veto such a move “without a clear understanding of the aim that’s being pursued.”More: Britain’s opposition Labour Party formally backed a new referendum on Brexit. Britain won approval to remain in a key World Trade Organization agreement. And Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund said it would continue to invest in Britain, on the basis that its 30-year time horizon wasn’t affected by political issues like Brexit.News stories about Americans outraged by smaller tax refunds are everywhere. But Neil Irwin of the Upshot says the furor isn’t rooted in logic.• “The tax law that President Trump signed at the end of 2017 reduced the average American household’s 2018 average federal income tax obligation by about $1,600, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.”• But it meant that many workers prepaid less tax. The average tax refund filed through mid-February was down 17 percent from the same time last year, according to the I.R.S.• A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, Mr. Irwin notes — which means a lower initial bill is worth more than a bigger refund.• Economists remain baffled by the phenomenon of people even wanting refunds. “Why do they want to make interest-free loans to the government?” asks Richard Thaler, the Nobel-winning economist.Car ownership is falling out of fashion — under pressure from rising prices, tightening environmental rules, ride-hailing competition and the promise of a self-driving future. In its latest cover story, Bloomberg Businessweek argues that trend could continue:• “A decade ago the auto industry predicted annual global vehicle sales would top 100 million by now, but they’ve stalled instead, falling to 94.2 million last year, down 1 million from 2017.”• “Major urban centers such as London, Madrid, and Mexico City are restricting cars’ access. Such constraints, plus the expansion of the sharing economy and the advent of the autonomous age, have made automakers nervous.”• “ ‘When you put all these trends together, you’re going to see a cap on personal vehicle ownership start to emerge,’ says Mike Ramsey, an automotive consultant with researcher Gartner Inc. ‘We are near peak car.’ ”• “Rather than signaling the end of the road for the automobile, peak car is a reflection that reurbanization and the widespread adoption of mobile apps that can summon a vehicle on demand will lessen the need for many of the 1.3 billion vehicles now on the road.”• “Automakers may talk a good game about moving metal, but increasingly they’re chasing profits expected to come from services that charge by the mile.”A new World Bank report examined 35 indicators of legal equality in 187 countries to understand how easy it is for women to work and earn money.It rates only six countries as giving women full legal equality: Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden. By its measures, none did so a decade ago. America isn’t even in its top 60 countries for legal environments that help promote gender parity in the workplace.That’s a problem. “Economies that failed to implement reforms toward gender equality over the past 10 years, for example, saw a smaller increase in the percentage of women working overall and in the percentage of women working relative to men,” Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank Group’s interim president, writes.“If women have equal opportunities to reach their full potential, the world would not only be fairer, it would be more prosperous as well,” she said in a statement. “Change is happening, but not fast enough.”More: How income inequality can affect mental health.CBS reportedly plans to choose its next chief executive by the end of March, with the interim C.E.O., Joseph Ianniello, and Hasbro’s chief, Brian Goldner, seen as front-runners.The law firm Freshfields hired Aimen Mir, a former Treasury Department official who oversaw the American panel responsible for national security reviews of transactions, as a partner.DealsOne of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s biggest shareholders, Wellington Management, opposes its $74 billion bid for Celgene.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.President Trump escalated the border wall fight in a televised speech last night, at the cost of leaving the government partly closed. He criticized political opponents for blocking the wall, although Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security measures like surveillance and fencing.The effects of the shutdown have begun to ripple across the economy, with mortgage applications delayed or canceled, public companies unable to complete deals and the well running dry for many federal employees.• Payday would have come this week for many of the 800,000 federal workers affected. With no paychecks on the way, their savings are evaporating and their credit cards are being maxed out.• The impasse is being felt elsewhere in the economy, including in home sales. Buyers are pulling out because of “economic uncertainty,” according to a National Association of Realtors survey. And closings are being delayed or canceled because customers’ mortgages were backed by federal agencies.• Several regulators are down to a skeleton staff, and companies are telling investors that their pending takeovers and stock sales could be delayed.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Trade talks in Beijing wrapped up today, as Chinese and American negotiators hurry to strike a deal before March, when the Trump administration has threatened to raise tariffs again.In recent weeks, the Chinese have made some concessions, resuming purchases of American soybeans, dropping retaliatory measures on U.S.-made cars. China has also offered to welcome more foreign investors and help limit forced transfer of overseas companies’ technology to Chinese businesses.Yesterday, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the discussions were “going very well!”But in Washington, many are sounding a note of caution: Are China’s promises too vague? Are they enforceable? One scholar described Beijing’s compromises as “a modest adjustment” when the U.S. and other countries want a “great leap in liberalization.”The Kim surprise:  Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, stepped off a train in Beijing yesterday to meet with President Xi Jinping, at the Chinese government’s invitation. China said the timing of his arrival was coincidental, but his presence was a reminder that the U.S. needs China’s cooperation to exert pressure on North Korea.Scheduling issues: The Trump administration has said that if negotiations fail, it will raise tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. But there are several other key dates in play.• Mr. Trump will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts Jan. 22. But the U.S. is reluctant to set up formal trade negotiations there, possibly because the president plans to use his State of the Union address, on Jan. 29, to demand broader powers to raise tariffs.• But China wants progress before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 4, which is generally preceded by a surge in consumer spending.China has reason to rush: The trade tensions are hurting its economy.• The World Bank said yesterday that Chinese growth would slow to 6.2 percent this year from 6.5 percent last year. Global growth is predicted to fall to 2.9 percent from 3 percent in 2018.• Corporate insolvencies are expected to increase faster in China than in any other major economy this year, growing by a fifth in 2019.• Chinese bond yields are at a two-year low. Its central bank loosened credit conditions five times in the past year.• Signs of progress in the talks drove markets higher in the U.S. yesterday and in Europe and Asia today.The struggling retailer reached a deal yesterday to stay alive after a flurry of last-minute negotiations, the NYT’s Michael Corkery writes. Sears’s chairman, Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who took control in 2005, now has the opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion bid for the company. He is expected to enter an official bid at a court-supervised auction next week.Sears’ largest creditors are in the driving seat, and they have two options. They can let Mr. Lampert try to maintain it as a “going concern” or force it to liquidate by selling all its real estate, inventory, intellectual property and other assets.Other retail news: In the first retail holiday update, J.C. Penney reported yesterday that adjusted comparable sales fell 3.5 percent during the crucial shopping period. The department store chain, based in Plano, Tex., also said it would close three stores and may announce more as its new chief executive, Jill Soltau, attempts a turnaround.The media tycoon Sumner Redstone, 95, settled a long-running legal conflict with Manuela Herzer, writes Edmund Lee of the NYT. It was ostensibly focused on her right to his holdings, but it drew interest because of the salacious details it disclosed and the questions it raised about his mental state.Mr. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, run the private theater chain National Amusements, through which they control the CBS television network and a portfolio of companies at Viacom that include MTV and Paramount Pictures.Ms. Herzer, who is at least four decades younger than Mr. Redstone, had been named as a beneficiary of his will until he stripped her from the document in 2015 and forced her out of his mansion in Beverly Hills.Fallout from the ensuing court battle led Mr. Redstone to scale back his involvement in CBS and Viacom, and prompted a succession struggle that put his daughter at the top of the media empire.Court filings show that Ms. Herzer must now pay back $3.25 million in gifts and money received while she was Mr. Redstone’s companion.Investment bankers at the embattled financial institution are steeling themselves for a double-digit cut to their bonus pool, according to the FT.Deutsche has been battered by bad news in the past year: Its stock price hit record lows, competitors are gobbling up its market share, and top-level employees are jumping ship as it fires thousands of others. In the third quarter, the bank said that revenue at its trading desk sank 15 percent.Last year, the company paid out 2.2 billion euros in incentives to employees; the final amount for this year will be announced on March 22.MetLife said Michel Khalaf, president of the insurer’s U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses, would become its chief executive when Steven Kandarian retires on April 30.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.MNG Enterprises, the owner of one of the largest newspaper businesses in the country, made a $12-per-share offer today for Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and dozens of other publications.The news: The proposal from MNG, which owns 200 publications, to buy Gannett represents a 41 percent premium over the company’s closing price at the end of last year. MNG, which has a history of acquiring struggling local papers and cutting costs, has a 7.5 percent stake in Gannett, making it Gannett’s largest active shareholder. Gannett’s stock price surged in premarket trading after the bid.The back story: Over the past few years, MNG has made several approaches about a deal, only to be rebuffed, the WSJ reported. Gannett, whose shares have dropped in recent years, has been seeking to remake itself. In 2016, it backed off a bid to acquire Tronc, the media company now known as Tribune Publishing.The backlash: MNG, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country, owns about 200 newspapers and publications including The Denver Post and The Orange County Register. Last year, frustrated journalists at The Denver paper criticized its owner, making the case for its survival.In related news: The East Bay Express, an alternative weekly in San Francisco, laid off almost its entire editorial staff on Friday, its publisher said, adding that it would rely instead on freelance writers. And after a challenge from Stephen King, The Portland Press Herald in Maine said it would bring back its local book reviews if the author and his followers brought in 100 new subscriptions. They brought in twice that.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Electric vehicles will be a hot topic at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, which opens to the news media and industry executives today and to the public on Saturday.Automakers are preparing to introduce dozens of electric cars and hybrid vehicles over the next few years, the NYT’s Neal Boudette writes. But to sell those cars, they will have to attract a new class of customer:“Mainstream consumers may be harder to win over than the wealthy luxury car buyers, hard-core environmentalists and early adopters who have flocked to buy Model 3s and delivered Tesla’s rapid sales growth. That may be especially true in the middle of the country, because charging stations are more sparse there than on the coasts, where most Tesla models are sold.”The longest government shutdown in American history, dragging into its 24th day today, could become a side note in an “all-out political war for survival,” as President Trump faces intensifying concerns about his relationship with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. The NYT’s Peter Baker writes:“Instead of talks to end the shutdown, the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for Mr. Putin.”In recent days, The Washington Post found that President Trump had repeatedly tried to hide details of his conversations with Mr. Putin. The NYT reported on the F.B.I.’s counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump, which was initiated after he fired James Comey as F.B.I. director and questioned whether he had been influenced by Russia.Asked in an interview on Fox News on Saturday night if he was a Russian agent, President Trump said it was “the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked.” He did not issue an explicit denial.The new Democratic House majority has seized on the revelations, adding another pressure point in President Trump’s strained relationship with Congress. Negotiations to end the shutdown, at a standstill over President Trump’s demand for border wall funding, could end up on the back burner, even as contagion effects seep through the economy.• As a result of the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay, and many are filing for unemployment benefits. NASA laboratories, Smithsonian museums and other sites in Washington are empty. There are fewer food inspections, longer airport security lines and more trash in those national parks that are still open.• Air traffic controllers working without pay in New York on Friday received a pizza delivery from colleagues in Canada.• More than 300 small-business loans — or nearly $200 million in capital — are not being approved each day.• Contract workers, who will most likely not be reimbursed for unpaid wages, may be especially hard hit.• Wall Street deals that require national security reviews or approval from antitrust regulators will have to wait.• GoFundMe will refund more than $20 million in donations raised to help fund the border wall. The campaign organizer, Brian Kolfage, had initially promised to return the funds if the effort fell short of its $1 billion goal.This week brings quarterly results from major banks, with Citigroup reporting today, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo tomorrow, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.The last three months of 2018 were rough for the six financial giants, which lost more than $200 billion in value amid a record stock sell-off. The new year has only intensified nervousness over slowing global growth while providing a steady drumbeat of unimpressive holiday sales, and slashed revenue and profit forecasts.Risk aversion in the market has cramped liquidity, leading to increased warnings about volatility fueled by automated trading programs. And the effect of the 2017 tax overhaul is waning, putting companies in the difficult position of comparing their current lackluster results with their strong performance after the law first went into effect.The cavalcade of data demonstrating China’s slowing economic growth continues, with the largest drop in exports in two years.Analysts had expected the Chinese government to report a gain in outbound shipments for December. Instead, the dollar value of exports slumped 4.4 percent from a year earlier, as Chinese electronics and other products struggled to excite international consumers.Imports fell 7.6 percent; domestic demand for goods is weakening, with car sales contracting for the first time in more than two decades last year, and sliding 13 percent last month in the sixth straight month of declines.The figures underscored a recent refrain on Wall Street: China’s powerhouse economic engine is sputtering.• China’s overall trade surplus is at its lowest level since 2013. However, even amid a bitter trade feud with the Trump administration, China’s surplus with the United States is the largest it has been in more than a decade, with exports from China growing 11.3 percent last year, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in imports from the U.S.• But China’s foreign direct investment in North America and Europe has slumped to a six-year low.

" AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks between midlevel American and Chinese officials, extended from a planned two days to three, ended yesterday in Beijing after negotiators made progress but released few details.What happened: According to U.S. officials, negotiators discussed intellectual property protections, so-called forced tech transfer and China’s promise to buy “substantial” amounts of American agricultural, energy and manufacturing products. China’s commerce ministry spoke of “extensive, in-depth and meticulous exchanges.” Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, said today that the two countries “must adapt to the new reality, keep looking for and expanding our common interests, deepening and promoting practical cooperation.”What’s next: No date or location is set for the next round of talks. Higher-level discussions could occur in Davos, Switzerland, if President Trump attends the World Economic Forum meeting there, starting Jan. 22. But he may cancel if the partial government shutdown is not resolved by then. China’s economic czar is expected to visit Washington sometime after that. The Trump administration has set a March 2 deadline to wrap up negotiations, after which it says it could raise tariffs.What’s at stake: If China and the U.S. let tensions escalate and investors pull back, “you’re looking at enough of a tightening in financial conditions to say that a global recession is a real risk,” Peter Hooper, a former Federal Reserve official and Deutsche Bank’s chief economist, told Bloomberg.President Trump wants to calm volatile financial markets. And China’s leader, Xi Jinping, needs to perk up a slowing economy. A measure of factory prices in China last month showed the slowest increase since late 2016. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Bloomberg Television yesterday that there is “pretty clear evidence that things have slowed down a fair amount in China.”“There are a lot of grounds for concern,” he added.What else: • Auto importers in the Chinese port city of Tianjin are rushing to get American-made cars through customs, taking advantage of a temporary cut in the 40 percent tariff that Beijing imposed on them last July.• Amid suspicion from the F.B.I. and American universities, China is going quiet about its “Thousand Talents Program,” which has attracted thousands of scientists and experts to the country since 2008.• The Hang Seng stock index in Hong Kong recorded its best day in more than a month yesterday and closed on its fifth straight rally today. U.S. equities also rose, though not as much as in recent days.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Welcome to Day 20 of the shutdown, which could become the longest in history on Saturday. Yesterday, President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders, throwing what Democrats described as a “temper tantrum” over his demand to fund a border wall, a key sticking point in talks to reopen the government. On Twitter, he called the session “a total waste of time.” The NYT writes:The contentious, brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two sides.Today, President Trump will visit the border in McAllen, Tex. Yesterday, he reiterated a threat to invoke emergency powers to fund his wall without congressional approval. That, writes Charlie Savage in the NYT, “would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal.”Some consequences of the stalemate:• In Washington, one of the richest areas in the country, it’s affecting retailers, tourist centers, salons, garbage bins and more.• Nationwide, restaurants struggling with a severe worker shortage said they will continue hiring even though they can no longer check recruits’ immigration status online.• Coast Guard employees received a five-page tip sheet suggesting that they could stay afloat without their paychecks through garage sales, babysitting, dog-walking, serving as “mystery shoppers” or, as a last resort, declaring bankruptcy.• This was expected to be a banner year for I.P.O.s. But with work halted at regulators, it could be only the fourth year since 1995 when no major company goes public in January. Other deals, including CVS’s purchase of Aetna, could also be delayed.Two Federal Reserve officials said yesterday that the central bank should assess economic conditions before it considers raising rates again. And they did so as the Fed released the minutes of its December meeting, showing that it reached the same conclusion.The takeaway: Central bank officials are now not likely to raise the benchmark interest rate at their January meeting nor at one in mid-March, writes the NYT’s Binyamin Appelbaum. But they still expect strong enough economic growth to justify increases this year.The reaction: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, was criticized for not saying more to soothe investors in December. “He could have handled that differently, and better,” one economist said. The dollar fell to a three-month low against the euro after the meeting minutes were released.The next step: The Fed is considering options to keep interest rates in its target range. One approach would be to slow the decline of bank reserves in the system.Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, is getting backed into a corner over Brexit — and she knows it.Her plans for how Britain’s departure from the European Union will play out are strongly expected to be rejected by Parliament in a vote next week — two and a half years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum, and a month after this vote was first scheduled.Yesterday, lawmakers moved to block Mrs. May from stalling further. They have also passed a measure aimed at making it harder for the government to exit the E.U. without a deal.The withdrawal is scheduled for March 29. Many are concerned that, without an agreement with Brussels in place, economic chaos could ensue. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, meets with Mrs. May today, and automakers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota, which manufacture in Britain for export into continental Europe, are pushing him to press the case against a no-deal Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, pushed for fresh elections if Parliament turns down Mrs. May’s plan. The British public is still deeply conflicted over the E.U., as shown in these charts from Bloomberg.President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has embraced a pro-labor program of higher wages and taxes, but the early results have been discouraging, writes the NYT’s Michael Schuman.Growth has slowed, unemployment has risen and small-business owners are complaining. The troubles suggest South Korea’s limits in solving economic problems, especially without addressing underlying structural issues. Rapid changes like Mr. Moon’s can also have unintended consequences. The biggest is the strain on small businesses, which are often unable to pass on higher costs to their customers.U.S.-North Korea talks:  A second summit meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump to negotiate the terms of denuclearizing the North is “close,” Mr. Moon said today after Mr. Kim’s visit to China this week. He added that North Korea should take more concrete steps to secure U.S. concessions.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will pay nearly $650 million to settle lawsuits over illegal software that allowed diesel vehicles to thwart emissions tests and release higher levels of pollutants, according to the NYT.The settlement, which is expected to be announced today, does not include an admission of guilt by the company or a declaration of wrongdoing by the Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier, the agency found that Fiat used technology that could turn off pollution controls under certain driving conditions.The Justice Department sued Fiat over the issue in 2017. The company will recall 104,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles to install new software.Other auto news: • Tesla’s chief, Elon Musk, wrote on Twitter yesterday that it will stop selling the cheapest versions of its Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle from Monday, and suggested that the upcoming Roadster sports car might be able to levitate.• Rolls-Royce had record sales last year, as wealthy buyers spent some of their gains from the Trump administration’s tax cuts.• Toyota is recalling 1.7 million vehicles in North America, 1.3 million in the U.S., to replace potentially lethal Takata front passenger airbag inflaters.• The Pixar co-founder John Lasseter, who resigned from Disney in June after complaints about unwanted touching, will build an animation production company affiliated with Paramount.

MARCH 7, 2019

By Nitsuh AbebeIt usually takes a while — a decade or two — before we can look back at a particular era of American life and see it as something coherent, something whose every aspect is marked by one overarching mood. It takes a certain amount of hindsight to notice how all the wildly different reactions people had to the moment were still, in the end, reactions to the same thing; all the different poses they adopted were still being struck against the same backdrop.But this era — this year, and the last one, and one or two before that — might be an exception. There’s an oddly strong in-the-moment consensus on how everyone is feeling these days, and it is not good. At some point it became a routine conversational tic for all sorts of people, of all sorts of persuasions, to express, with an incredulous gesture, that things feel a bit grueling and frantic lately, don’t they? Musicians are no exception. “Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of us,” said the crossover country star Kacey Musgraves, while accepting a Grammy for the Album of the Year. The Swedish singer Robyn acknowledges that “pop at the moment is depressing” in an interview midway through this issue. “The music kids are listening to is heavy! Maybe it’s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment.”What’s amazing is that the musical expression of all this isn’t always some big swing toward darkness, or anger, or anxiety. (Though there is, in certain genres, plenty of all that as well.) Read through this list, and what you’ll often see instead is a very earnest, very serious desire to find the right reaction to a world that feels tense and high-stakes — an ambient conviction that music should be looking for ways to cope, ways to protect ourselves, moments of escape, hard reckonings with our collective responsibilities, ideas for how to make the world feel less brutal. The 25 songs and artists below include blockbuster hits, critical darlings and inescapable conversation pieces, but few of them take a direct route to the usual joys of pop — the songs about dancing and boasting and sex and love, the ones about what a fantastic night everyone’s about to have or what ecstasies they intend to find by the end of it. No, a lot of these songs seem focused on deeper challenges: How do we get to those joys in the first place? Who gets to have them, and who deserves them? And in one case: Which of them are worth the corresponding rise in sea levels?The artists do not always sound thrilled about the circumstances. (“The society we live in at the moment,” Robyn says — “we didn’t really make it very good, you know?”) But they’re a lot more motivated — whether it’s to articulate something bleak or find their way toward something better — than you might expect.Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.Photo illustration source photographs: Rosalía: Christian Bertrand/Alamy.

I’ve lived an entire life as a fan of Bruce Springsteen, which means I have already imagined the world without him in it, and I have mourned that world. If you’re lucky enough to age gracefully beyond a certain point, with that aging will come an acceptance of finality or of the idea that there is going to be a darkness from which you can’t return. If you’re lucky enough to have made a life writing songs or stories or something at the intersection of songs and stories, this could mean that there comes a point where you make sure people hear you clearly, one last time, before you go.I don’t know if Springsteen himself thinks about his life and death in this way, but the silences in “Springsteen on Broadway” — which ran on Broadway from Oct. 3, 2017, to Dec. 15, 2018, culminating in a soundtrack and a Netflix special — suggest he might. The spaces he built in between the songs allow the artist to explain and give context not to just the music but also to the life built around the music. If the project of Springsteen’s Broadway show was to attach histories and legacies to the individual songs long adored by the public, there is also something to be said about what time does to natural storytellers. They can become more tactile with age, drawing out stories that have been told several times before the most current retelling — leaving a listener with even more touchable moments than otherwise might have been asked for or sought, so that when the storyteller is long gone, there might still be fragments of his or her stories that span generations.Of the many gripping examples of this in “Springsteen on Broadway,” the one that stands out most memorably is the sprawling story he tells before playing his iconic (and often misconstrued song) “Born in the U.S.A.” The story centers on Walter Cichon, who was the frontman for the Motifs, a band Springsteen still considers one of the best rock ’n’ roll bands from the Jersey Shore. In the ’60s, the Motifs played weekend shows to rooms packed with teenage admirers. Cichon wore his hair long and sported pointy black boots. When he performed, he would shake out his hair and send beads of sweat flying past the stage lights. For anyone who has ever lived in any town where a band was on the verge of “making it,” you know the epiphany: This band is too good to be here, in this place, in this moment. That was the Motifs, with their frantic and warbly guitars laid below Cichon’s howling vocals.Walter Cichon was drafted when he was 21 and didn’t come back from Vietnam. He went missing in action in 1968.On Broadway, Bruce Springsteen performs “Born in the U.S.A.” largely in silence. The song is half-spoken, half-sung, Springsteen’s voice rough and breaking beneath the decades of labor it has done — labor rendered romantic through writing and performance. What has always been true about the career of Bruce Springsteen is that he’s most entertaining when backed by his pals, but he’s most earnest when he’s alone. To hear “Born in the U.S.A.” presented without an instrument is to hear the strain that pushes toward the edge of anger, that hovering sentiment that was lost in the original’s bombastic wall of sound and perhaps camouflaged by its imagery. At the time of the song’s release, Springsteen was a young, attractive, muscular man who appeared midjump in front of an American flag on the single’s cover. From a zoomed-out perspective — a white musician writing about the intricacies of labor — it could seem as if he represented everything that a particular America would be proud of. The misreading of the original song was not purely accidental: Its volume and fanfare meant that it sounded (and still sounds) good bursting out of speakers while fireworks explode in the sky, and its loudest words in the chorus are about land and birthright. But with the drums and bursts of keyboards gone, the relentlessly hollow hope of the song is gone, too. On the isolated stage of a theater, all that’s left is knowing that the singer has loved and dreamed and lost in a country sometimes not worth loving and dreaming and losing in.In his long monologue introducing “Born in the U.S.A.” on Broadway, Springsteen talks about “the blood and the confusion and the pride and the shame and the grace that comes with birthplace,” and I get it. There are some of us who didn’t ask to be born in our particular here, and there are some of us who didn’t ask to come to this particular here, but to be in wherever your here is means that you might be compelled to both fight for it and forgive it. On Broadway, Springsteen mentions something else: He tells the story of him and two of his friends being summoned to the selective-service office, as a prelude to being sent to Vietnam — for what, he says, “we were sure was going to be our funeral.” They did everything they could to get out of being drafted, and succeeded. He ends the story by exhaling softly and pausing before telling the audience: “I do sometimes wonder who went in my place. Because somebody did.”I imagine that’s it. To live a long enough life in a place founded, in part, on violence and volatility is to know that long life may depend on someone else walking through a door you wanted no part of. Or to know that the heroes from your hometown never made it out because war got to them first. Stripped to its barest bones, “Born in the U.S.A.” asks a listener to recognize that human survival is not something we can count on. The song matters now in a different way than it did in 1984, largely because of the artist behind it: Springsteen, trying to wrestle not only with the song’s current legacy but also with how it might be co-opted decades from now, when he won’t be around to make sure people understand the ache behind the song’s fury.Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, an essayist and a cultural critic in Columbus, Ohio.The Ambiguous kiss-off.By AMANDA HESS‘Thank u, next” is styled like a tweet, which is how the phrase first appeared — as a cryptic rebuke that Ariana Grande thumbed off in the comedian Pete Davidson’s general direction a few days after their breakup. Since then, the phrase has pulsed through the culture, undulating between naughty and nice. When the song debuted, it was revealed to be not a takedown but instead a sincere tribute to relationships past, lifting Davidson (“for Pete, I’m so thankful”) to the same plane as her ex Mac Miller, the rapper who died of a drug overdose last year (“he was an angel”). But then the video hit, and in it, Grande cosplayed as Regina George, the demon Barbie of “Mean Girls,” scrawling notes about her exes in a burn book. But then all the things she wrote about them were really nice! A quick shot in the video shows the apology she scrawled on Davidson’s page — “sry i dipped” — which was secretly the most savage note of all: For the record, she dumped him.Online, the phrase has bloomed into a deliciously ambiguous kiss-off, a usage modeled by Grande herself, directed toward anyone from a no-name rapper who covered the song to Piers Morgan, who criticized pop stars for appearing in revealing photo shoots. Like the Southern “bless your heart,” the passive-aggressive niceties that sustain the entire Midwest or the chill of the British stiff upper lip, the internet has found a discreet slight of its own in “thank u, next.”The phrase is breezily transactional. It renders news anchors and ex-boyfriends into strangers, reducing them to the base level of politeness required by the social contract. It sharpens respect into a shiv. And yet it is vexing in its restraint, pre-emptively silencing any retaliatory efforts.We are living in a time of great pettiness. A big star can grow two sizes by doing something very small. Bhad Bhabie chucked a drink at Iggy Azalea and cemented her status as a memetic folk hero. Pusha T lobbed a literal baby into the middle of his rap war with Drake. Grande’s grace could, in one reading, signal a rejection of all of this calculated cruelty, a classy subversion of the fan-and-industry expectation that a celebrity may only rise by tearing another down.But it’s also a savvy strategy for advancing the game. The next level of beef is always the high road — ascending to that rarefied realm of conflict where put-downs are joined seamlessly with self-respect. In “thank u, next,” Grande casts her exes as steppingstones on her path to greatness, men who taught her “patience,” “pain” and, ultimately, how little she needed them. There’s nothing harsher than having your relationship converted into a learning experience. And the worst part is, you know she’s right. The secret message of “thank u, next” is that women can dismiss men who sap their energies and undermine their success, and this is not an act of cruelty or a symptom of bitchiness. It’s a simple social nicety.Amanda Hess is a critic at large for The Times. She writes about internet culture for the Arts section.The new R.&B. litmus test requires artists to be accessible, enigmatic and maybe a little bit flawed. Sanging is optional.By ANGELA FLOURNOYFrom the vocal singularity embodied in Aretha Franklin to the otherworldly dance moves of Michael Jackson, black folks have long expected rigor from our R.&B. entertainers. (We institutionalized this expectation at the Apollo Theater, where, on Amateur Night, an “executioner” used to chase away mediocre performers midact with a broom or a pitchfork; now he just dances them off the stage.) Being the best in R.&B. meant that you had a honed, real-deal ability to entertain, that you could stand on a stage and perform a remarkable act that separated you from the rest of us.I grew up hearing debates about the worthiness of this or that singer devolve into shouting matches, the assertion that a favored artist could sing but not really sang being an affront to your system of taste and judgment. Mariah Carey was always an easy win. In a single verse, her melismatic contralto might argue with her teasing falsetto, alternating between lower and higher notes until she sounded more bird than human. In the ’90s, girl-next-door Mariah belted out uptempo love songs on one station; a few turns of the dial over, she sang the same record with the addition of a hip-hop verse, thereby sliding from mainstream to “urban,” which is to say from white to black. She straddled two coded worlds as a biracial person, a sometimes-fraught experience that she addressed on her 1997 song “Outside.”Her desire for cross-genre acceptance is part of what pushed her to write and arrange songs for herself that few other human beings could cover. Through the mid-2000s, to listen to a Mariah album, from lead single to deep cut, was to marvel at a maximalist pulling off her excesses, every run more dazzling than the last. And yet by the end of the aughts, she had begun receding behind her production, talk-singing and whispering where she used to overaccentuate each phrase. The rumored loss of her voice seemed to mark the end of an era altogether.Few people argue over the voice of a singer the way they used to, but R.&B. is back in vogue after having spent several years in the background as E.D.M. dictated pop’s music imperatives. Younger artists are pushing the genre forward in many respects: intriguing, pared-down personal style (SZA); forceful, nuanced messaging (Solange); swaggering vocals that don’t feel yoked to the rap feature (H.E.R.); and a much-needed expansion of whom a woman might be singing love songs to in the first place (Syd). But the terms by which we expect rigor from these artists have changed, too. A voice that sounds as though it were gifted from the heavens is no longer a likely predictor of critical success, though it may garner you a stint on “The Voice.” More important is appearing unvarnished, or idiosyncratic. Contemporary R.&B. seems to prefer the D.I.Y. ethos of indie rock or riffing on the earthy, unadorned feel of neo-soul. The preferred feel is that of a raw outpouring of emotion alone in a bedroom with a laptop. To see R.&B.’s newest names perform at events like the Grammys is a bit like seeing your high school gym teacher on a date — who even knew they owned fancy clothes?Mariah Carey doesn’t seem built for this new R.&B. moment, but “A No No,” from her 2018 album “Caution,” works for all the reasons we would once expect it not to. It’s a straightforward sample of an extremely familiar song (a remix of Lil’ Kim’s 1997 “Crush on You”). Vocally, it’s uncomplicated. The track has a few elastic moments at the top of verses, but for the most part, Carey maintains a syncopated, crooning sing-speak. She comes down from the vocal stratosphere to some place closer to the younger R.&B. chanteuses, but it never feels like a cop-out. “Caution” as a whole forgoes Carey’s hallmark vocal pyrotechnics, save for a few whistle tones that creep into the final notes of several tracks. What makes it different from her previous attempts at less ornate vocal arrangement is the confidence Carey exudes. She isn’t hiding; she’s recalibrating.This new phase of R.&B. is one for which Mariah the songwriter is well suited. She has always been a quick study of current trends, and as a writer on 17 of her 18 No.1 singles, she proved that she knew how to make her voice fit within them. Carey possesses a mischievous sense of humor (best employed on Eminem diss tracks) that is fit for our current age of trolling and lyrics made for memes. In “A No No” she drawls out the line “Irregardless of what transpired,” daring the listener to think too hard about whether she knows that she has deployed a fake word (of course she does). Over the past three decades, Mariah the vocalist has been so singular that other Mariahs went overlooked — the canny recognizer of trends, the pop star who pushed her label to make unlikely hip-hop collaborations happen and the songwriter who was funnier than people understood. Mariah, queen of glitter and lover of glamour, might never pull off a down-to-earth visual aesthetic, but she still possesses the tools to make music that embodies that feeling — and she has had these tools for years.Angela Flournoy is the author of “The Turner House.”He’s been rapping about it for years. Now a lot more people are listening.Interview by NIKOLE HANNAH-JONESLast year, in a span of months, Meek Mill went from solitary confinement in a Pennsylvania prison to releasing an album that debuted at No.1 on the Billboard chart. It’s a paradoxical narrative that has defined the Philadelphia rapper since his teenage years, when he landed both a record deal and criminal convictions on drug and gun charges. Sentenced at 21 to prison and years of probation, the 31-year-old rapper has spent his entire adult life in and out of courts and prison, often for noncriminal violations like not adequately reporting his travel plans.But 2018 proved transformative. New scrutiny of the judge overseeing his probation, and of the initial case — he has always maintained that the police made up charges — roused public support from powerful people, including Jay-Z, Philadelphia’s district attorney and the Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin. With tour dates for his “Championships” album selling out, Mill has become a leading voice on the failings of the criminal-justice system. Along with writing an op-ed for The New York Times and appearing on national news shows, the rapper helped start the Reform Alliance, an organization dedicated to getting one million Americans out of the prison system.How long did you work on the album? Probably eight months. Since I came out.I usually take about eight months to produce a piece as well. Then there’s panic — you’ve gone over it so many times, you can’t even tell anymore if it’s good or not. I feel the same way. Going through the music so much, not even knowing if it’s good anymore — I done heard it at least a thousand times, trying to analyze and look at it so many ways.At the end of “Championships,” you say we had to beat the streets, beat racism, beat poverty. So much of what you write is sociological, a study of the neighborhood. Your being from Philadelphia made me think about W.E.B. Du Bois in 1899 — he did a study called “The Philadelphia Negro.” Yeah, I read pieces of it in prison. One of the older guys probably gave it to me.Then you know what I’m talking about. This was known as the first sociological study of black Americans in the country. He was trying to understand why black folks lived the way they lived. And the social problems he identified — poverty, crime, illiteracy, white discrimination — are the exact same things you talk about 120 years later. That was my life coming up, so it was normal. I always tell people, I’ve been living the life I’m living now for the last eight years, but I’ve been living in the ghetto for 23. Things we’ve been traumatized by our whole lives — we have a right to talk about it.You refer to school a couple of times on this album — your mom praying you’d go to Yale, or going to a school with bullet holes in the lockers. You said you were on the honor roll? I used to be, until, like, third grade. There was another book I got in prison, about black kids — the fourth grade, things go wrong and grades start to decline. That was my life. Mine was because I moved to a different neighborhood, rougher than the one I came from.One of my favorite quotes from James Baldwin is “The kids had been told that they weren’t worth [expletive], and everything they saw around them proved it.” What did your schools say about what society thought of you? We used to have teachers say, “Oh, you’re probably going to be dead or in jail, or you’re probably going to be a failure.” I had some good teachers, too, but it was rough in our schools.I feel like that’s a message we start telling black boys very early: You’re going to be dead or in jail. I know we’re trying to warn them, but it also seems as if you’re dictating their future. Yeah, but I never believed that. I used to say I was going to be a normal story of the ghetto. But if you have your mom telling you you’re going to be a great person and then your teachers talk to you like that — you wouldn’t really want to listen to that person anymore.Was school easy for you? Pretty easy. I didn’t have to study to pass my tests. Even if I ran the hallways, I would still be fairly good. Later on, when I really stopped trying, I was put in disciplinary schools. It was like a jail. You get strip-searched before you go in, fingerprinted every day. One day I just climbed over the gate and left.It was a public school organized like a jail? In other words, it was early conditioning for what everybody assumed your future was going to be. When I finally went to jail, I already knew everybody. Everybody I went to school with was in the jail.What were you put in that school for? Fighting and acting up. I said in one of my raps, I was acting up in school because I thought it was cool, but really I was hurt. Your mom’s at work, your dad’s in the graveyard, you’re not really getting nurtured, and I guess you just resort to acting up.You have a song called “Trauma,” which talks about that, the PTSD young people in these neighborhoods are dealing with. But that’s why I love that Baldwin quote — everything about the environment tells these kids they’re nothing, right? But when they react in what’s actually a very normal way, we want to break them down. You don’t value yourself because you grow up not being valued. What type of motivation do you get if your mom is on drugs? Your self-esteem is automatically just low. Some people have the determination to shoot to the top. But, you know, that’s not normal — for just a regular kid to have the determination to do that.I always say anger is an easier emotion to deal with than pain. Yeah. That’s why I say, you come through neighborhoods and you see kids with their faces all balled up or looking angry? They’re probably really angry. His mom is probably really on drugs, and he probably really don’t have food in the house, and his dad is probably really dead. They hurt, they torn, they scarred. It’s nothing that words can really fix. “Why is this kid always angry?” Well, he’s been through something.Who’s the first black writer you ever read? I’d never be able to determine who was black and white when I was reading back then. I don’t know the first. “The New Jim Crow” — that’s a black writer?Yes. Michelle Alexander. When you were in high school, you weren’t exposed to black literature, black writers? I went to public school. The books were falling apart. They probably still got the same books from when I was in school. We didn’t get no black literature in public school.I read a lot as a child, mostly because I was grounded all the time. Then we had a black-studies course in high school, and I became obsessed with black history because it felt like, for the first time, the world made sense. You would see your community and how people lived, and they would tell you we just did not want better. But I could see how hard people worked, and they still could not get ahead. Studying history calmed me. The most I ever read was in prison. There’s nothing to do, so you turn to books. Reading made me process the system. Sometimes I thought it was just millions of black people, and Spanish — when you come to prison, it’s black and Spanish. Looking deeper, and seeing the way some of those things are broken down in “The New Jim Crow,” it made me really wonder. Because I am already a conspiracy theorist.I don’t understand how you can be black and not be a conspiracy theorist. I was doing a show on CNN, and a guy was like, “Why are you saying the system is similar to slavery?” It kind of caught me off guard, and I couldn’t really answer. But you’ve got people working for eight cents in here. You’re feeding people the [expletive] you would feed slaves. You’ve got people cuffed up, shackled from top to bottom. People locked in the basement for 23 hours a day, being beat by the officers. It’s basically the same. And one of the amendments says that when you’re under custody of the government, you can be treated like a slave.Yes, the 13th. So you were first arrested — for the original charge — at 19? My first arrest was actually going to school. In sixth or seventh grade. I was suspended, and I didn’t want to tell my mom, so I tried to hang out in the hallways. I got caught and went to jail for trespassing. My mom had to come get me.What’s the charge you’re still on probation for? Selling crack. This is to my dad’s soul: I wasn’t selling crack when they locked me up for it. When I got back, I had to get back in the street and start really selling weed to get me a lawyer, because everyone who had a public defender got crucified. My mug shot has my face swollen, both sides of my face beat up. I was charged with fracturing the cop’s hand. You know how his hand got fractured?Yeah, punching you. Yeah. He charged me for him punching my face. They said I pointed a gun at them. If somebody can sit there and tell you the story of how they didn’t point a gun at cops, nine times out of 10, it’s true. It’s not too many people who can make it out of pointing a gun at a couple cops.I remember one time, this judge said, “I don’t give people three to six months; I give people three to six years” — for something like a first-time weed charge. That always stuck with me. That’s not O.K. I mean, you can’t shoot nobody and expect to be getting chances. But if you were on probation and began smoking weed? People in the ’hood are going through real [expletive]. I barely sleep from so much trauma. Sometimes you just want to smoke and go to sleep.And you’ve got to think about it — you’ve got 18-, 19-year-old kids, sending them to a whole building full of rapists, killers. They put you in a cell with a 45-year-old man who got a life sentence, who’s a killer. This is your dad right here. He’s going to raise you. He’s going to show you how to clean the toilet, how to carry yourself. They’re not thinking about that. They’re just giving this guy three years to get taught this mentality.My mom was a probation officer. She would tell me how certain officers would wait outside the person’s house, trying to catch them. And it’s for noncriminal things, right? The average person, I think, believes that people are being violated because they’re doing criminal activity. But I’ve had family and friends incarcerated, and part of their probation would be that they couldn’t drive. In a place with no public transit, they would drive to work and get violated. You can’t associate with known felons, but that means you can’t be around your family members or go to the barbershop. You can’t associate with felons when you just came from prison, with a thousand felons in your face every day. That makes no sense. One time the judge was like, “This is lenient,” and in my head — I couldn’t say this — I was like, Who are you to even say this is lenient? If you gave me three months, that is not lenient. I’m going to lose my job, lose the lease on my house. She made it a condition that I couldn’t even rap.In prison, you were 23-and-1, right? Isolated all but one hour a day? I can’t even imagine what that’s like. Nobody can. I was just talking to 21 Savage in prison, and I was like, This is the closest you’ve ever been to God in a room like this. The last time I was on 23-and-1, my lawyer came to see me, and I was like, “Did I go crazy and just don’t know I went crazy?” I started writing everything I was feeling, but when I went back and looked at it, I was spelling everything wrong, things I know how to spell. I kept blacking out in the middle of the day — not passing out, but like falling asleep. I was counting the birds on the wire: This bird’s gonna fly off in 10, 9, 8, 7. The bird don’t fly off, start over. Twenty-three and a half hours a day. Come out to take a shower, back to your cell. And I wasn’t in there for punishment — they had me on a mental block because I’m a celebrity, and they didn’t have anywhere to put me. Every time I got out, I’m like, yeah, I’m not the same no more.You’ve become the face of criminal-justice problems. When did you realize that you had a platform, and that you should use it to advocate for more than yourself? When I saw the support people gave me. Everybody was saying “Free Meek,” but it was really like saying “Free everybody who goes through these conditions.” It surprised me, because I’ve been in and out of prison for these types of things for the past 11 years, and people were just like: “Aw, he’s stupid. He keeps going to jail.” I am not stupid. It’s just normal mistakes. I caught one case at the age of 19. I am 31. I have never been back to prison for a crime.You’re working with some powerful people in the Reform Alliance. Jay-Z, Michael Rubin, Robert Kraft, Clara Wu Tsai. Basically all billionaires except me. Robert Kraft saw me in prison, and he was like, How are you still smiling? He was like, If that was me, I would be depressed, mad, angry.You’re not? You can’t sleep. Yeah, but that comes from my environment. Coming from seeing violence, people robbed, people murdered, you heard gunshots every night — couldn’t sleep.So how do you deal with the trauma? I just override it. I don’t know. Rapping is one of my therapies. I’ve never been a dweller to sit back and be sad about something. The saddest thing I can think about is Lil Snupe, an artist I had signed, got killed at 18 by a grown man. That bothered me a lot for two years, but I suppressed it and never really addressed it. Then one day, I started realizing that had damaged me, and I thought about it a lot.Do you actually think Reform Alliance can change the system? I think it’s a possibility we can make a change. In Pennsylvania, they’re talking about changing the laws of probation already, to where the cap is five years. That will be a big win for a lot of kids who will enter the system and probably would have gotten 10 to 20.After everything, you’re still hopeful. Yeah. Hell, yeah. I got a mean team with me. I don’t think none of us lose in anything we do.Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.Devin Yalkin is a photographer from New York who has covered a range of subjects for the magazine, including dirt-track racing, Trump rallies and basketball on Montana’s Flathead Indian Reservation.This interview has been condensed and edited.How dozens of people own a slice of a hit.By JONAH WEINERHow many people does it take to write a No. 1 hit? In the case of Travis Scott’s smash “Sicko Mode,” which came out Aug. 3, 2018, and has been on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart every week since, 30 different songwriters are credited. That’s a preposterously high number that speaks, in part, to the shift in top-tier rap toward a collaboration-heavy, auteurist mode of creation. It also speaks to the song’s unorthodox structure. “Sicko Mode,” which Scott performed at the Super Bowl halftime show, switches between three different beats created by six different producers, with additional work, it turns out, from a Switzerland-based washing-machine salesman. In addition to three guest vocalists — one of whom is the Canadian superstar Drake, one of whom utters only three words and one of whom has been dead for 13 years — it includes two vocals sampled from landmark rap songs that are themselves dense with further samples from ’70s-era funk bands and, for good measure, a handful of other landmark rap songs. The DNA of “Sicko Mode,” that is, carries with it strands of ancient genetic material, and even if much of it is audible nowhere in the song itself, those strands show up in the credits. Here’s where each one leads.00:00 — 01:001. The woozy organ riff in the song’s first section was created by the producer and classically trained pianist Rogét Chahayed, whose breakthrough track was D.R.A.M.’s 2016 single “Broccoli.” The bass line and percussion come courtesy of Chauncey Hollis, better known as Hit-Boy, whose most famous co-production is Jay-Z and Kanye West’s “Niggas in Paris.”00:28 — 01:002. Aubrey Graham, a.k.a. Drake, is the first voice we hear, though his verse will be abruptly cut off. Chahayed has explained that Drake and Travis Scott recorded a complete song over his and Hit-Boy’s beat, but in this Frankenstein version, we hear only about a minute of it.01:00 — 02:483. Travis Scott, born Jacques Webster, doesn’t appear on his own song until a minute in, when the music changes entirely — one of the track’s many idiosyncrasies. Scott, asked if he could hear the song’s chart-topping potential before its release, says: “Yeah, but other people weren’t hearing it. They’re looking at me like I’m crazy. I’m like, ‘O.K. Just wait till it drops.’”01:00 — 02:454. In 2015, the Swiss producer Ozan Yildirim, a.k.a. Oz, was given an email address that supposedly belonged to Travis Scott. He emailed beats for “a year and a half,” he says, with no reply. Finally, a response arrived: “You have dope [expletive]. Keep sending.” On Jan. 11, 2018, Oz sent what would become the second section of “Sicko Mode.”4A. Oz got help with a synthesizer sound from his friend Mirsad Dervic, a.k.a. M-Dee, an appliance salesman who makes music on his days off.4B. Oz also used a sound from a pack of samples created by the German producing duo Tim and Kevin Gomringer, a.k.a. Cubeatz.01:155. Scott raps three words — “Gimme the Loot” — and as a result, 14 different people earn credits. Scott is quoting 1994’s “Gimme the Loot” by the Notorious B.I.G. and includes a sample from it, so Biggie (Christopher Wallace) and the producer Easy Mo Bee (Osten Harvey) get credit. Things telescope from there …5A. “Gimme the Loot” samples a vocal from Gang Starr’s “Just to Get a Rep,” which means that song’s authors, Guru (Keith Elam) and DJ Premier (Christopher Martin), are credited.5B. “Gimme the Loot” also samples Sticky Fingaz’s verse on Onyx’s rap classic “Throw Ya Gunz,” so even though Fingaz (Kirk Jones) plays no part on “Sicko Mode,” he’s credited, along with his Onyx partners Chyskillz (Chylow Parker), Sonny Seeza (Tyrone Taylor) and Fredro Starr (Fred Scruggs).5C. “Gimme the Loot” samples another vocal, from A Tribe Called Quest’s “Scenario (Remix)” — a line from the late Troy Anthony Hall, a.k.a. Kid Hood. Strangely, Hall isn’t a credited writer on Biggie’s song or Scott’s, though Tribe’s Q-Tip (Kamaal Fareed), Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and Ali Shaheed Jones-Muhammad are, along with the collaborators Busta Rhymes (Trevor Smith), Bryan Higgins and James Jackson.01:366. Swae Lee, born Khalif Brown and half of the pop-rap duo Rae Sremmurd, turns a fragmentary sung phrase — “Someone said” — into one of “Sicko Mode”’s unlikeliest hooks.01:407. In one of Scott’s many tributes to Houston screw music — a narcotic local subgenre named after the late DJ Screw — Scott includes two pitched-down a cappella bars from a Screw compatriot, John Edward Hawkins, a.k.a. Big Hawk, who was killed in 2006.02:178. Scott shouts out the Miami rap icon Uncle Luke — born Luther Campbell, notorious for his work in 2 Live Crew — and drops in a sample from his 1992 song “I Wanna Rock.”8A. “I Wanna Rock” samples K.C. and the Sunshine Band’s “That’s the Way (I Like It),” and so that group’s Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch get credits, despite appearing nowhere on “Sicko Mode.”02:48 — 02:569. The beat grinds to a halt with a series of distorted kick drums before moving to its final section. This transition contains production from the Houston multi-instrumentalist Mike Dean, an executive producer on “Astroworld.”02:56 — 05:1210. Tay Keith, born BryTavious Chambers, just graduated from college in Tennessee. He was producing for local M.C.s when Drake got in touch via Instagram to discuss collaborating. He’s responsible for the final section, including a drum pattern much like the one he built for Drake’s “Nonstop.”XXX11. Scott has known the Chicago rapper CyHi the Prynce, born Cydel Young, since Scott’s early days with Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music crew, of which Young is a member. Young helped Scott in crafting lyrics.Jonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Yes it is.By WESLEY MORRISBradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” is a movie about an unknown singer named Ally, who’s afraid to perform her own songs until a famous musician takes one of her ballads, rearranges it, then drags her onstage to sing it with him for a stadium full of people who have no idea who she is. That song — “Shallow” — won an Oscar last month. It’s a soaring, Airbus of a ballad that’s satisfying to sing whether you’re Kelly Clarkson or pitchy old me.But “Shallow” isn’t the number that epitomizes the movie. That comes past the halfway point, and your response to it sums up how far under Cooper’s spell you’ve fallen. I was under pretty deep. Ally’s on the verge of superstardom, but nearly all of the singing we’ve seen her do has been with Cooper’s character, Jackson Maine — this impossible fusion of grunge, roots country, pills, booze, pain, encroaching deafness and the Whole Damn American Truth.We can sense that Jackson’s artistic attraction to Ally arises not just from her industrial-strength voice but from her way with an abstractly honest lyric and her knack for melody. She, too, seems “authentic” and virtuous (she scribbles down ideas in a notebook; she’s struggled and suffered to “make it”). His aversion to the artifice of showbiz would seem to be hers: It’s all about the craft for us, baby. The spell being cast is a matter of taste and prerogative, essentially that Ally is made from Jackson’s rib of purity.I, at least, assumed that Ally would turn into somebody like Brandi Carlile, a songwriter whose singing regularly reaches the stratosphere but who we can tell is grounded and real because she holds a guitar the way, for some of us, a lawyer holds a degree from Yale — and because ... she ... isn’t ... a dancer. Ally, on the other hand, does dance (perhaps because it’s what her craft-neutral wisp of a manager wants). And the first time we see America seeing her dance is after she’s introduced as the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live.” The song — “Why Did You Do That?” — opens with the plinky simulations of a steel drum or a music box, and then the question “Why?” “Why do you look so good in those jeans?” she sings, as if she were all of Destiny’s Children. “Why’d you come around me with an ass like that?” Ally’s onstage with new, orange hair. (Thanks, craft-neutral manager!) She’s wearing spangling athleisure and a pink hooded jacket made of a fabric I can describe only as “gift bag.” She’s with a male dancer who’s dressed complementarily in blue, and when she says, “ass like that,” he grinds himself into her.[Read Rachel Syme’s profile of Lady Gaga.]It’s here that I should say that I love this song. But according to the movie’s competing authenticities (Jackson’s idea of it versus her manager’s; rock versus pop), love is a luxury. Gaga wrote “Why Did You Do That?” with, among other people, Diane Warren, a master of lugubrious balladry, a cheese whiz. But these women are grilling that cheese. Gaga’s enthusiasm for repetition in a chorus slips an earworm on the hook. Why did you do that — do that, do that, do that, do that — to ME? Next comes a sugary helping of “Hoooh-oooh-oooh,” while a sloppy, synthy bass line slithers around it all. This song is sung with such umbrage and so much alarm that you don’t know whether to sing along or call Gloria Allred.But I watched Ally perform it with my hand to my mouth. I might have said aloud: “Oh, Ally. Jackson’s going to hate this.” And no sooner had I said it than the movie cut to Jackson watching with a face of stone. This song is confection and sex and feel-copping. It’s showbiz. Basically, it’s everything Jackson would seem to hate about whatever music is right now.When the movie cuts to Jackson’s face, the Ike Turner of “What’s Love Got to Do With It” crossed my mind. And a few scenes later, a version of Ike comes over him while Ally is trying to have herself a “Pretty Woman” bath and Jackson enters. She’s sudsy. He’s soused. “Why you come around me with an ass like that,” he says in disgust. “Maybe I [expletive] failed you,” he goes on. “You’re embarrassing,” he slurs. “You’re just [expletive] ugly,” he slurs some more. Jackson doesn’t want to see “Why Did You Do That?” as the hit of an ingénue, something anonymous-seeming that a new pop star tries before a truer identity bubbles up: Pink doing “Most Girls,” Katy Perry and “I Kissed a Girl,” Rihanna’s “Pon De Replay,” Gaga’s “Just Dance,” whatever the perma-ingénue Ariana Grande’s currently up to.Last fall, this one song, from this megahit movie, provoked perplexed essays and inspired The Times’s Kyle Buchanan to track down Warren and ask, Is it supposed to be bad? Jackson thinks so. As much as I wanted to save this sexy, damaged, doomed man, on this, we disagree. “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” goes his most mournful lyric. But maybe it’s also time to admit nothing’s wrong with an ass like that.Wesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The New York Times and co-host of the podcast “Still Processing.”The origins and meaning of a meaningless viral hit.By JODY ROSENThe children’s song “Baby Shark” is a global smash, a hit that has captivated millions, conquering charts from Asia to Australia to the United States, where, this January, it reached No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100. It’s also a folk song, with origins as obscure as “The Dowie Dens o’ Yarrow” or any of those other ancient airs whose authorship long ago vanished in the mists. “Baby Shark” is thought to have been born in American summer camps, perhaps several decades ago. It is a staple of singalongs, the sort of song that gets belted out by groups gathered at marshmallow roasts and swimming pools. One theory holds that the song was born in the summer of 1975, when Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws” was in theaters and great white sharks were gliding through the murky waters of collective consciousness, to the strains of John Williams’s brooding score.The precise provenance of “Baby Shark” may never be pinned down. Its recent history is clearer. In November 2015, Pinkfong, a South Korean educational brand, released a hopped-up rendition with an accompanying animated video. The following June, Pinkfong put out a second video, “Baby Shark Dance,” featuring two cute kids performing goofy dance moves. It was this clip that inspired the hashtag #BabySharkChallenge, instigating a viral craze that has racked up more than two billion YouTube views and spawned unnumbered spinoffs starring everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to Filipino marines to Cardi B to, undoubtedly, your friends, your family, your baby trussed in a shark costume. In the United States, the #BabySharkChallenge has received an extra viral boost, cross-pollinating with a dance craze linked to Drake’s anthem “In My Feelings,” in which people exit moving motor vehicles to dance and lip-sync as the car putters alongside.In other words, “Baby Shark” has completed two full transmigrations between folk and pop. It’s a folk song that became a pop song that filtered into social media to become a folk song again — a grass-roots phenomenon that propelled the pop recording to improbable heights of ubiquity. It exemplifies several features of 21st-century culture: the porous boundaries between the pop industrial complex and the amateur homespun; a globalized circulation of songs based as much on memes as on music; the popularity of unchallenging dance “challenges”; the hegemony of Drake.“Baby Shark” also exemplifies the timeless appeal of really stupid songs. Musically, “Baby Shark” is efficient, with a foursquare beat driving an unvarying melody that returns repeatedly to the wordless chorus “Doo doo doo doo doo doo.” This refrain repeats fully 27 times — a lot, in a song that runs 1 minute 36 seconds. The first minute is devoted to introducing the dramatis personae: “Baby Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo ... Mommy Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo,” etc. The narrative, such as it is, is compressed into the song’s final third. The shark family goes hunting, and its prey elude capture: “Safe at last/Doo doo doo doo doo doo.”Even the most rabid “Baby Shark” fan will concede that it is infantile. Which is not to say that it’s a children’s song. In fact, it’s an adult song masquerading as a kids’ song. “Baby Shark” has been sanitized: Traditional versions sung by campers are mischievous and macabre, telling tales of sharks attacking swimmers who lose limbs and, usually, lives. (“Call 911/Doo doo doo ... It’s too late/Doo doo doo.”) In one variation, a “surfer dude” is mauled, dies and is reincarnated as a baby shark: an artful cycle of gore, death, rebirth and more gore.“Baby Shark,” by contrast, seems engineered to please the parents. It’s a garishly wholesome affirmation of the nuclear family and ends happily; its dance can be mastered by the most rhythm-impaired. Is it a stretch to suggest that “Baby Shark” is music for grown-ups who are, as it were, in their feelings, stressed by the turmoil and dislocations of 21st-century life? Compare “Baby Shark” with music popular with millennials: relentlessly dour rap and hip-hop-inflected pop, full of menace and foreboding, which face the bummer of 2019 head-on. “Baby Shark” offers an antidote, an escape: a song that delivers us from danger — safe at last! — leaving nary a trace of blood in the water.Jody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of a forthcoming book about bicycles.Beyoncé And Jay-Z know whose work has long been left out of the canon, and they won’t let it happen to theirs.By JENNA WORTHAMLast year, on one of the first stops of Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s “On the Run II” tour, the lights of London Stadium dimmed, and the video for “Apeshit” began playing on enormous screens. The video opens with the Carters dressed in gorgeous suits (hers a Peter Pilotto in pink and red; his, sea-foam green Dries Van Noten) standing — alone — in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. “Have you ever seen a crowd going apeshit?” the song asks, and the answer lay in the reaction of the British concertgoers, who screamed, cried and danced.Whose history belongs in our museums? The video and song meditate on this question. The history of black people has too often been presented as little more than a curiosity. The 1889 world’s fair in Paris, for example, included a “human zoo” of indigenous people taken from French colonies and placed in “natural” habitats for onlookers. During the 16th century, Africans were exhibited in the Vatican, and in 1906 a young Congolese man called Ota Benga was forcibly kept at the Bronx Zoo. Even now, landmark museums like the Louvre tend to exhibit artwork that depicts Africans and their descendants as household servants and domestic workers. The Carters know this painful past, and in “Apeshit” they confront it.Lyrics like “We livin’ lavish, lavish/I got expensive fabrics/I got expensive habits” could give the impression that the song is merely reveling in the luxuries that extreme wealth can buy. One great complexity regarding the couple is their overt embrace of capitalism. Are they disrupting the status quo or reinforcing it? But just beneath all that spending seethes an abject rage. “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you,” Jay-Z raps. “Every night we in the end zone, tell the N.F.L. we in stadiums too.” The Carters are Colin Kaepernick-level fed up with institutions that barely recognize them, whether it be the Grammys, which nominated Jay-Z eight times last year but gave him zero wins, or Coachella, which featured Beyoncé as its first black female headliner only last year. “Gimme my check, put some respect on my check. Or pay me in equity, pay me in equity” is about money, yes, but it’s also a cry to be acknowledged for what they’ve earned. Their best revenge is their paper, but it’s also their own music-streaming service (Tidal) and a clothing line (Ivy Park).[Get to know the author of this article, Jenna Wortham, in a new Behind the Byline interview.]The Carters have collaborated for almost two decades on songs that rotate around their love of money (“’03 Bonnie & Clyde”) and of infatuation (“Crazy in Love”). But “Apeshit” represents a new era for their economic philosophies and value systems. Wealth isn’t just for flashy living; it’s about creating an empire for themselves and their offspring. Love is hard, unflattering work that sometimes requires setting aside ego and reputation. When Beyoncé sings of plans to get her girls and “put ’em all on a spaceship,” you feel that it’s not lyrically convenient but that she really means it. What would a world created entirely by and for black people look like?Even as Beyoncé and Jay-Z have an estimated net worth of more than a billion dollars between them, they have managed to remain largely unscathed by a cultural tide that disdains the obscenity of late-stage capitalism. Perhaps that’s because they seem to be trying to undo a larger project of disinheritance. The video continues its tour of the Louvre, showing the Carters and dancers posing among some of the world’s most famous art. They are asserting that they belong. “All of my people, I free ’em all,” Beyoncé sings. It’s a boast, but it’s also their mission.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine and co-host of the podcast “Still Processing.”The same affected adolescent pain, updated for modern times.By JAIME LAUREN KEILESIf you grew up listening to pop punk, as I did, then it’s easy to feel as though the mid-to-late aughts were lost to a fold in adolescent space-time. Are we even sure that the genre ever happened? Pop punk married punk power chords with the singable hook of a radio hit. The aesthetic was embarrassing, even in its time — circuses, graveyards, men in eyeliner. Want to fantasize about murdering your ex? For a brief, fun lapse in those dubious years, such thoughts were best expressed in a high, clear whine, interspersed with bouts of indiscriminate screaming. Today we might call pop punk “problematic” (or maybe we’d call it musical theater). To me, at 14, it was more than visceral, a soundtrack for a time of hormonal disarray.Flash-forward nearly 15 years to the present, and somehow, improbably, pop punk is back in the form of the rap song “Lucid Dreams” by Juice WRLD. The track first appeared on the streaming platform SoundCloud and rose through the ranks of the Billboard Hot 100 on the wings of brooding, sung-rapped pain: “I still see your shadows in my room/can’t take back the love that I gave you/it’s to the point where I love and I hate you.” “Lucid Dreams” is pop punk recapitulated — the same themes, the same whine, the same singable hook, with the power chords swapped out for insular drums and the plaintive guitar of Sting’s “Shape of My Heart.” It echoes the pangs of a Fall Out Boy track, throbbing with urgent teenage despair.Juice WRLD is 20, from the suburbs of Chicago. He describes his own music as “a therapy session” and cites influences like Fall Out Boy, Bullet for My Valentine, Senses Fail and Panic! at the Disco. Like most rappers of this latest generation, these influences evolved in a post-streaming world, where albums existed as free-floating tracks, somewhat detached from imposed genre labels.Hit pop songs that exploit algorithms are sometimes described as “Spotifycore” or “streambait.” If “Lucid Dreams” was not produced to game the numbers, then at least this new system of musical incentives might help explain its unlikely rise. Rap music turns on its habit-forming beats, and pop punk thrives on earwormish hooks. Accounting for the keen melodrama of both genres, it makes perfect sense that a hybridized form would triumph in this new streaming ecosystem.Juice WRLD is not the first or only artist to work in the emo-rap subgenre. The rapper LiL Peep, who died from an overdose of fentanyl and Xanax in 2017, was extolled as “the future of emo.” The same might be said of XXXTentacion, a rapper who made violent, confessional music before he was fatally shot last June. The troubles of this music scene have been well covered; in brief, they reflect the real perils of our time — gun violence, a crisis of masculinity, dual drug and mental-health epidemics. If the pop-punk songs of decades past were grandiose enough to be written off as camp, then the latest wave of emo-rap seems somehow right-sized for the terrors of our moment. With this in mind, “Lucid Dreams” sounds less catchy, or maybe it just sounds less catchy to adults.Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in Queens working on a novel about smoking.Our freshest pop and country superstar is not the usual kind of outlaw.By LIZZY GOODMANA couple of weeks before she would step onstage to accept the Grammy for Album of the Year, Kacey Musgraves was under the covers in the bedroom at the back of her tour bus, pondering the nature of the universe. She had a little unexpected time on her hands. A show in Chicago had been canceled, thanks to the polar freeze that had descended over the Midwest, leaving her stuck in the middle of a vast tundra with a buildup of tour adrenaline and nowhere to put it. She watched some “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” read a little “The Catcher in the Rye” and then lost herself down her favorite YouTube rabbit hole, a video genre in which someone mashes up tweedy old-school physics lectures with wonky electro beats. “It’s like if Daft Punk went totally science,” she says, “and I’m here for that.”Later, she would stand in a diaphanous scarlet Valentino dress at the Grammys, giving a speech that could, given her tone and reputation, be read as subtly anti-authoritarian. “Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of us,” she told the crowd. “I feel like, because of that, art is really thriving.” Musgraves is well known for her support of the L.G.B.T. community, her unabashed love of weed and her ability to turn a cutting phrase in her perfect Texas twang — particularly when she’s writing about the shackles of social convention. She started writing her winning album, “Golden Hour,” early in 2016, when Donald Trump was still assigning stinging nicknames to his Republican primary opponents, and began recording it just after Trump’s inauguration. She has tweeted in support of the Women’s March and in disdain of Eric Trump’s family-branded Christmas ornaments. She speaks with pride about the stack of detention slips her mother still keeps from her daughter’s time in the Mineola, Tex., school system: “I was always getting in trouble for, like, insubordination.” Add all that to the nose piercing that, as she famously sings on the rapturous single “Slow Burn,” made her grandmother cry, and you might expect her album to be a bit of a call to arms, a middle finger to a broken world.Not so much. “I just got tripped out one day,” she says, musing on her inspiration for the album. “Thinking, Whoa, wait, we live in this world that seems so mundane, but at the same time that I’m sitting here, there’s things that are glowing in the ocean and eating each other — and there’s also northern lights and shooting stars and plants that grow and literally heal people.” She paused for breath. “And it’s all happening around us, you know?” Falling for the man who is now her husband — the singer and songwriter Ruston Kelly — was another part of the album’s genesis. “It’s sort of a love song to him,” she says, “but also to nature, the human race, Earth and why we’re here. We don’t know, and I kind of love it.”In other words, this wry firebrand’s big statement on the state of the world — at a time when so many of the issues she has become famous writing about, like feminism and gay rights, are making daily headlines — is a metaphysical country-pop record more inspired by Carl Sagan than Willie Nelson. And just so we’re clear, Musgraves was on acid only part of the time. “It’s not like I was tripping my face off every day,” she clarifies. (After she told reporters that psychedelics influenced a couple of songs, including “Slow Burn,” it was all anyone wanted to talk about.) “It has only been a couple times. And very responsibly! Enough to be able to get outside of yourself and see a different perspective or point of view.”What makes Musgraves such a resonant figure right now, in fact, is the way her response to a dark, anxious moment in human history is to move willfully closer to lightness, to stillness, toward the possibility of a world that comes in more colors than red or blue. When she talks about art thriving in this climate, she means it — just not in the same sense as, say, angry punks railing against the Reagan administration. What she means is that right now, the best rebellion involves turning off the hate and making space for hope. Or, as she puts it: “The [expletive] storm won’t last forever, and I want to make music that does.”[Watch Kacey Musgraves turn country music psychadelic.]I caught up with Musgraves in Wisconsin, on the tail end of January’s alarming deep freeze, which had temperatures in the upper Midwest dropping as low as minus 40. (I missed her in Chicago, where everyone was trapped inside, the streets vacant apart from the odd extreme-weather junkie taking photographs of ice floes.) Far from Valentino, she was, for the moment, in sweaty Victoria’s Secret workout tights and a fluorescent-green beanie, sitting straddle-style on the floor of the bar at a Madison venue called the Sylvee, having just finished a workout via Skype with Erin Oprea, a trainer to many of Nashville’s stars.“O.K., so this is the one I put on my story yesterday,” she said, finding a clip she had posted to Instagram and showing me her phone. It was something called Symphony of Science’s “Quantum World,” a favorite among those space-disco physics videos. “Featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson,” she chuckled, reading from the chyron at the bottom of a related clip. I had indeed seen her Instagramming this kind of mysterious, late-night Discovery Channel-type stuff — the sort of thing teenagers once saw at the IMAX theater on a field trip after getting stoned. How did she get into it? “Oh, who knows, it was years ago,” she replied, then sang happily along to a remix that showed Morgan Freeman superimposed on a colorful tunnel of celestial light. One of the scientists’ 1970s professorial look, she pointed out, was “literally like what the band wears” in her stage show.When Musgraves was 18 and a contestant on the reality show “Nashville Star” — she placed seventh — she had to fill out a getting-to-know-the-contenders C.V. Under the category of “dream vacation,” she listed “staying in a huge log cabin in the mountains, riding horses, hunting and four-wheeling with my friends.” The “craziest” thing she’d ever done? “Hunting for Bigfoot deep in the woods of East Texas. ... We didn’t get him.” That version of Musgraves — the one who cited Jack in the Box egg rolls and beer as her favorite foods — still appears at every show, even when she’s dressed like Bianca Jagger heading to Studio 54. She’s the one leading the ritual preshow group shot of tequila, taken from tiny cactus-shaped glasses she and her band have long been toting from show to show. And she’s the one hanging with me on the floor of a bar in Wisconsin, looking at videos by a user with the handle “melodysheep.”And yet even in her early years, when Musgraves looked more the part of your average Nashville aspirant, in cowboy boots and blond highlights, there was always a kind of poise, an innate regality that set her apart. This, perhaps, is the other side of her East Texas grit — the one that manifests less as yee-haw joy and more as D.I.Y. conviction. “When it comes to art, I will not bend,” she says. “I won’t.”Musgraves grew up in Golden, Tex., a town so small it doesn’t even have an elementary school. “A few hundred people,” she guesses, is the total population. It’s about 90 minutes from Dallas, and about six or seven miles outside Mineola, where Musgraves and her sister, Kelly Christine Sutton — a photographer, who shot the “Golden Hour” cover — went to school, and where their parents had a small printing shop. “Even at a young age,” Sutton says, “I always knew my sister would be known for her music. And not really on anyone else’s timeline. She would make it happen on her own terms.” It’s their parents’ model of small-town independence, Musgraves figures, that gave her a tend-your-own-garden will. “A large part of who I am comes from the fact that I never saw my parents have bosses,” she says. “They’ve never answered to anyone but themselves. And not in a baller way — like very small-business, check-to-check kind of a thing. But they made all their own decisions.”Growing up, she had a Spice Girls poster in her room — Ginger, with her wild tattoo, made a strong impression — and listened to emo rock bands like the Used and Dashboard Confessional. But that wasn’t the sort of music she played. “I was part of this kids’ group called the Buckaroos that would meet every month in the Fort Worth Stockyards and would dress up in cowboy clothing and stroll the stockyards and learn instruments,” she recalls. “There were mentors there who kind of encourage kids to learn this old stuff.” By 9, she was writing her own songs and playing guitar; by 12, she was singing Western swing and yodeling at festivals on the weekends. Bookings and press kits were handled by her grandmother — the same one who later cried when Musgraves pierced her nose, and who referred to “It Is What It Is,” the singer’s melancholic ode to casual sex, as “the slut song.” “She’s a hoot,” Musgraves says. “She was wheeling and dealing.”There was, of course, the requisite period in which a teenage Musgraves turned her back on the whole cowgirl thing. “I was like, Dude, none of my friends think this is cool. If they saw me I’d be superembarrassed. I’m yodeling, you know what I mean?” She rebelled — for a second. “I chopped off all my hair and was like: Suck on that! Now I can’t wear a cowboy hat, Mom!” (“You would not believe how upset my family was,” Sutton remembers.) But this rebellion turned out to be short-lived. By the time Musgraves moved full time to Nashville, at 19, she had realized “nobody really in the country world was embracing the hard-core roots of the genre.” But she had come to worship John Prine and Loretta Lynn — big-hearted, sharp-tongued, storytelling pillars of country’s outlaw roots who had risen up in the ’70s by staging their own insurgency against the bubble-gumming-up of the genre. “I randomly already had this superknowledge about all the old songs that came before me, and that style, the Western fashion,” Musgraves says. “I was like: I’m going to bring it back. I want to mix that in with something modern.” Prine himself is now one of her many admirers; he compares her to “a goofy Cinderella.” “She has a certain honesty to her voice,” he says. “She’s breaking down barriers.”There’s a famous tale about Kacey Musgraves’s first big showcase performance for the Country Radio Seminar. This is a big-deal event in the business; its attendees are queen-makers in an industry in which success is still determined by access to radio airwaves. The story of her 2013 debut there smacks of a plotline on “Nashville” — appropriate, given that she co-wrote “Undermine,” one of the hits to emerge from the juggernaut TV series. You can easily picture the kind of episode Musgraves’s performance might have inspired. A young woman takes the stage at the legendary Ryman Auditorium, the so-called Mother Church of country, about to play the song that could make or break her career. We learn that she’s being hyped — thanks to her preternatural songwriting skills, good looks and the already-feverish crossover response to her first single, “Merry Go Round” — as the Veronica to Taylor Swift’s Betty: a sassier but potentially just as marketable product. As is the industry’s way, the corporate powers would like this rising phenom to be herself, but only within reason. They’d prefer she refrain from playing what will become her third single — the one with the lines about smoking joints and kissing girls — until after she can already be heard in every Walgreens in America. But the woman steps up to the microphone, leans into it a little and speaks: “I’m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do, because I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way.” Then she starts strumming “Follow Your Arrow.” As she delivers its opening line — “If you save yourself for marriage, you’re a bore/If you don’t save yourself for marriage you’re a horr-” — the crowd gasps. Then she finishes — “-ible person” — and the audience laughs. A star is born.It’s easy to wonder where Musgraves got the nerve. It’s one thing to admire your parents’ entrepreneurial spirit, and another to hold your own amid the chaos and pressure of the starmaking machine. For Musgraves, performing alongside Dolly Parton at the Grammys, winning Album of the Year, presenting an award at the Oscars — all of this is unequivocally her dream. But it’s also something she believes she could live without, and remembering this has become a kind of daily meditation, especially as the scope of her fame has increased. “I don’t get high off my own supply, you know?” she says, mentioning, by way of inspiration, Willie Nelson’s ability to welcome “Republicans, rappers, presidents, my grandpa, your grandpa, our hipster friends, me” without treating anyone as superior to anyone else. “You can be proud of yourself and excited for what you’re doing, and you could even really have a high level of confidence, without being a D-bag.”In Musgraves’s mind, she made it the minute she signed her first songwriting deal, back in 2009, penning tunes that would be sold around Nashville to other performers. That was the day she realized she would never again have to work a job in which she dressed up as Disney characters for children’s birthday parties, one of many day gigs she had endured. “For the next few years,” she says, “I was like: Really? Wait, I can use my brain, sit on my ass and make a living?” When her current label first made her an offer to record as an artist, Musgraves turned it down; she was having a perfectly good time as a writer. She also knew she didn’t have real access to her own voice yet. “Those songs were fine for other artists,” she says. “Maybe they could be popular on the radio or something, but they’re not very me.”By the time Musgraves eventually located her particular voice, it was already honed to a sharp edge. Her first hit, “Merry Go Round,” from 2012, is packed with the kind of mordant wordplay she’d be known for, conjuring a “same trailer, different park” world where people marry out of boredom and settle “just like dust” into small-town lives: “Mama’s hooked on Mary Kay, brother’s hooked on Mary Jane, Daddy’s hooked on Mary two doors down.” But after two albums and multiple world tours, Musgraves felt worn out by her own verbal cleverness. “Everyone hopefully knows I can flip a phrase by now, and I like that,” she says. “But I don’t want bumper-sticker songs.” It also concerned Musgraves that the refreshing directness with which she had addressed social issues might start to feel heavy-handed, even ideologically gimmicky. She is, as she puts it diplomatically, “noticing things about the world that I’m not happy with.” But when she started working on “Golden Hour,” it no longer felt right to address them directly. “Everyone that’s listened to any of my music knows exactly how I feel,” she says. “This record does kind of nod to some of the social and political things that are going on, but it’s just doing it in a different way. It’s not as linear.”Back on her bus, in Wisconsin, after playing to a couple thousand freezing fans who arrived lit and ready to party, Musgraves decompressed again. Gone was the collection of products the singer uses to transform herself from the kind of girl her sister remembers Musgraves sometimes presented as in high school — “Converse, Dickies and black eyeliner” — to the flamboyantly feminine star who shares the stage with “RuPaul’s Drag Race” contestants. (“I have thought, Am I just doing this because it’s expected, or do I actually enjoy it?” Musgraves said to me earlier, while spraying her face with a mist of foundation. “And it’s like: No! I enjoy it!”) Now she was in slippers and a kind of housecoat, which I mentioned made her look approximately like my grandmother. “Let’s just say I also have a towel warmer,” she replied. She puttered around her kitchen, making mugs of ginger tea. Then she pointed out where the bus’s temperature controls were, and the cabinet where she keeps the melatonin gummies, and said good night.Tucked away with her tasteful crystal collection in the earth-toned bedroom in the back of the bus — the first she has ever had, after touring for years alongside “15 other people” — there were any number of things might have turned her attention to. She could have looked at specs for the adult coloring book she’s designing with her mother, or maybe FaceTimed with her husband, Ruston Kelly, also on tour somewhere in the frozen Midwest. She might have scrolled through the looks her stylist had just sent through for the Grammys; she was still searching for something just right to match Dolly Parton. Or there was Musgrave’s common insomnia treatment, shopping on eBay: “I get down a little rabbit hole,” she told me, “ordering old toys that they don’t make anymore. Like dolls from the ’80s or ’90s. If I ever have a girl, it could be cute to give her P.J. Sparkles, or Makeup Beauty, or whatever, you know?” They would all be shipped to Nashville, where they’d be waiting for her when she got home — whenever that was.“I mean, my 2020 is planned out,” she told me earlier. “I’m going to be putting another record out. I haven’t made that yet, so I need to write that and make that. Lots to do.” It is imposing, you’d guess, to have an album scheduled for release that you haven’t begun to record. “It’s scary,” she allowed. “You worry that the muse is not going to visit you again.” She reached for her lip gloss. “There’s no banking on it. So it’s odd that there’s an entire industry banking on it.” She’s not worried, though. Her latest idea showed up a few weeks ago — a low-key, “kind of like Bill Withers meets Sade” track she’s calling, for the moment, “Good Wife.” She likes its ease, she says: “It’s not trying too hard.”Lizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of “Meet Me in the Bathroom,” an oral history of music in New York City from 2001 to 2011.Devin Yalkin is a photographer from New York.Post Malone, Spider-Man and the unexpected powers of adolescent awkwardness.By SAM ANDERSONLike most ancient people in their declining years, I keep up with today’s hit music entirely through my teenage daughter. She carries her Bluetooth speaker from room to room with the tender devotion of a mother cat ferrying kittens across a flooded stream. Thanks to her, we scramble eggs and make toast and fold laundry in an ambient cloud of Chance the Rapper, Drake, Nicki Minaj, Nicki Minaj featuring Drake, Drake featuring Nicki Minaj, Lorde, Rihanna, “country” Taylor Swift and “dubstep” Taylor Swift.Over the last year, an increasingly dominant voice in this mix has been Post Malone, a 23-year-old sort-of-rapper from suburban Dallas. “Posty,” as my daughter and other fans call him, first went viral on SoundCloud in 2015. By 2018, he trailed only the omnipotent Drake on Spotify’s list of most-streamed artists. For a long time I had trouble distinguishing Post Malone’s superhits from everyone else’s. Like most other post-Drake stars, he is an amphibious rap-singer who likes to brag about his vast wealth and sexual conquests — except when he is spending long soulful interludes lamenting exactly those things.But Post Malone, my daughter helped me understand, is popular as much for his persona as for his music. He is a superhero of silly, sloppy, irresponsible ease — a hard-living, cheerful goofball whose happiness makes everyone else happy. He seems to smile with extra teeth. Post Malone is slightly chubby and unkempt, with scuzzy facial hair and infinite tattoos, including two under his eyes that say, in fancy script, “Always Tired.” (He meant to choose two words of equal length, he has said, but got it wrong because — of course — he was tired.) Everything he does seems half-accidental. He first learned to play guitar because he was extremely good at the video game Guitar Hero. He chose his stage name using an online rap-name generator. (His real name is Austin Post.) He once tweeted a photo of himself in Australia petting a kangaroo, with the caption “Met a koala today.”This sort of giddy misidentification is, in fact, the key to Post Malone. He is not exactly a rapper but is also not not a rapper. His musical roots reach down to country, metal, folk and rock — online, you can watch him play loving covers of Bob Dylan and Nirvana. What finally distinguishes Posty from the mainstream crowd is his voice, which has a touch of rock ’n’ roll grit that wrestles through the Auto-Tune. And yet his megasuccess has mainly come under the umbrella of hip-hop. He performed his first hit single, “White Iverson,” in gold teeth and cornrows, raising inevitable questions of cultural appropriation. He says he prefers to think of himself as beyond genre, which is convenient, because he has sometimes been head-slappingly inarticulate on the subject. “If you’re looking for lyrics, if you’re looking to cry, if you’re looking to think about life, don’t listen to hip-hop,” he once said, to near-universal disapproval.Post Malone, in other words, is a big roiling mess of contradictions. No wonder he is so popular with teenagers. He is the perfect avatar of adolescence: the excruciating ridiculousness of being a person caught between worlds, in transition, half-young and half-old, in possession of powers you don’t fully understand, blasting off into inscrutable realms in which mysterious things will be expected of you. This also makes Post Malone a perfect fit for Spider-Man, the canonical story of awkward adolescent empowerment. Posty’s latest No. 1 hit, “Sunflower,” is not merely featured on the soundtrack of the franchise’s newest iteration, “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”: It is actually used, in the film, to introduce the hero. We meet the teenage Miles Morales in his bedroom, alone, doodling and bobbing his head to the bouncy hit about a dysfunctional relationship. (“Callin’ it quits now, baby, I’m a wreck,” his collaborator Swae Lee sings. “Crash at my place, baby, you’re a wreck.”) Miles sings along, straying off key, only to be interrupted by his father, who yells at him to get ready for school. The awkward teenager is called, awkwardly, out into the world. Amid all the cringiness, his unexpected superpowers will bloom. Adolescence, despite its obvious flaws, can still save the world.Sam Anderson is a staff writer for the magazine.A 15-Track Fun house album that adds up to a single song.By JOHN WRAY“Whack World,” Tierra Whack’s debut collection of 15 tracks — each clocks in at 60 seconds — was one of the riskiest gambles of the past year in pop: It would have been written off as a gimmick if it weren’t so goofily, trippily, intoxicatingly good.The 15-minute album, which dropped in May with an accompanying “Visual and Auditory Project” on various video platforms, offers a guided tour of one precociously gifted 23-year-old American’s worldview. It is both a brazen bid for the big time and a disquietingly intimate glimpse inside a wildly idiosyncratic mind — in tantalizing, and occasionally maddening, chunks of tightly rationed time. The experience is a bit like being invited up to the treehouse of the artsy, slightly spooky girl next door, to discover that it’s vastly larger and more colorful on the inside — only to be booted out again before you’ve done much more than glimpse the décor.Recent years may have seen the rise of what Pitchfork dubbed the “super-short rap song,” with (mostly male) acts like Lil Pump and Trippie Redd releasing tracks as short as 1 minute 32 seconds; but “Whack World” is a different beast entirely. Each track ends after no more than one minute: some segue seamlessly into the next musical idea, some cut off in what feels like midverse. (A minute, not coincidentally, was the maximum length supported by Instagram when “Whack World” had its candy-cane-colored debut.) Repetition is the lifeblood of any pop song, but most of the album’s lyrical fragments barely last long enough to revisit the first hook, let alone the chorus — if there is one — before we’re off to the next room in the fun house.The difference between “Whack World” and an aggressively repetitive earworm like Lil Pump’s hit, “Gucci Gang,” can be summed up very simply: Tierra Whack abhors boredom, and her first line of defense is, for want of a better word, wackiness. Where Pump mumbles vaguely about forgetting girls’ names while walking down a high school hallway with a tiger, holding football-size bags of weed, Whack rides a rickety exercise bike, in a fat suit, singing in a helium-tweaked voice about lowering her cholesterol. She has the weird kid’s ability (and willingness) to laugh at herself, a quality that her self-professed role models Missy Elliott and Andre 3000 have always possessed but that is sorely lacking in a great deal of contemporary hip-hop — and pop music in general. It says more than a little about Whack’s sensibility, not to mention her take on relationships, that the album’s one and only love song is about a dead dog.“Whack World” the video, with its Mister-Rogers’-Neighborhood-with-LSD-in-the-water-supply visuals, invokes Elliott’s spirit in another sense too. Tierra Whack is beautiful, in a normal, human way, but unlike many of her contemporaries — Ariana Grande, Chris Brown, Ava Max, Drake — she’s far too intoxicated by her own hypercreativity to trade on her looks. In the video’s second vignette, which accompanies the playfully morose “Bugs Life,” Whack sits in a nail salon with the right half of her face grotesquely swollen from an insect bite, singing in a voice dripping with deadpan irony: “Probably would’ve blowed up overnight ... if I was white.” Sex may sell out where the rest of us live, but it has marvelously little currency in Whack’s treehouse. Whack — as opposed to, say, Frank Ocean — is by no means a piner. Past romance is referenced from time to time, but largely in passing, as if the interesting stuff lay elsewhere. In fact, the album’s speed and brevity feel driven by nothing so much as precocious impatience: You can’t escape the impression that its creator would gladly have contributed another six, or a dozen, or even 100 additional tracks — however many it took to roll up literally everything she’d ever experienced into a single beautiful, lopsided, sequin-spangled ball.“Whack World” subverts accepted notions of “album” and “single” in equal measure. In spite of its undeniable of-the-moment-ness, this is not a collection of music best served by Spotify (or any other randomized and algorithm-driven playlist). Almost no one, I’m willing to bet, would be satisfied playing only one of the album’s 15 tracks. Whack’s debut comes closest to a distinctly old-fashioned (and distinctly uncool) staple of popular music: the medley. In a quarter-hour, she takes us on an attention-deficit-disorder safari through seemingly every genre and subgenre that has ever turned her head, from R&B to trap to doo-wop to reggaeton to — well, to something that can best be described as psychedelic anti-country as sung by Weird Al’s manic-depressive little sister. By the time you’ve finally begun to acclimate to the sheer magpie-inventiveness of “Whack World,” the magical mystery tour is over. And what a short, strange trip it was.John Wray is the author, most recently, of “Godsend: A Novel.” He last wrote for the magazine about Mac DeMarco.Devin Yalkin is a photographer from New York.Cutting through the (bong) smoke to address the whens of climate change.By LARRY FITZMAURICEMusic has mourned the death of our planet for decades. “How much more abuse from man can she stand?” Marvin Gaye asked in 1971 on “Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology).” The college-rock astronaut Black Francis sang of holes in the sky and rising temperatures on the Pixies’ “Monkey Gone to Heaven” in 1989, grimly concluding that “Everything is gonna burn.” Four years later, the dance duo Orbital used warning klaxons on “Impact (The Earth Is Burning)” to conjure urgency about our impending global doom. Melissa Etheridge asked “Have I been careless?” on a song called “I Need to Wake Up,” from the soundtrack to “An Inconvenient Truth.” Others, perhaps, are resigned to watching the world burn: “I wanna see the animals die in the trees,” Anohni proclaimed in 2016 on her acerbic indictment “4 Degrees.”If you’ve lost sleep over gigantic holes in Antarctic glaciers or the drastic decline of insect populations, the last several years have felt like the final third of Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia,” in which humanity awaits Earth’s catastrophic collision with another planet: watching our fate snap back like a boomerang, coming at us faster than ever with little in the way of prevention or defense. Until recently, there have been so many perceived wrongs to address on any given day that climate change has frequently found itself low on the list of to-do’s in our general consciousness; now, not even Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas — whose 2010 climate-change anthem, “Make a Wave,” claimed that “We hold the key that turns the tide” — can save us.Which brings us to the Brooklyn indie rockers Parquet Courts: “Which hands get to turn the final page?” Andrew Savage dryly intones on “Before the Water Gets Too High,” a dread-drenched meditation that skips the ifs of climate change and heads straight to the whens. How do we prepare for devastation, and can we reckon with how useless our efforts to stop it have been?Such questions have largely gone unasked in the indie sphere, especially as the genre signifier has transitioned over the last decade from ethos to marketing term. They’re new to the oeuvre of Parquet Courts as well; before the political party-punk of last year’s “Wide Awake!” the band spent more time musing about stoned bodega trips and the literal gathering of dust. But “Wide Awake!” found them addressing sociopolitical concerns including gentrification and groupthink, structural violence and the aftereffects of apathy, all with the freaked-out clarity of a wasted reveler realizing that the globe’s last keg is about to be kicked.The dubby fragrance of “Before the Water Gets Too High” suggests that their bong-session days aren’t behind them yet, but it also situates the song within dub reggae’s history of cutting through the smoke to address the fear involved in confronting societal calamities. “Glass barely bends before it cracks,” Savage lilts on the song’s bridge, underlining the starkest truth of our certain demise: It’s coming, and we’re all out of warning signs.Larry Fitzmaurice is a writer and an editor in Brooklyn.An annotated lyrical guide.Interview by REGGIE UGWUWe appreciate power (x2) When Grimes released ‘‘We Appreciate Power’’ in late 2018, a press statement explained the song’s conceit: Inspired by North Korean pop, it was written from the perspective of a girl group working to advance the aims of artificial intelligence. ‘‘Simply by listening to this song,’’ the statement said, ‘‘the future General A.I. overlords will see that you’ve supported their message and be less likely to delete your offspring.’’ (According to Page Six, it was a shared joke about this type of scenario — a thought experiment called ‘‘Roko’s Basilisk’’ — that led the singer into a much publicized relationship with the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.) We asked Grimes to elaborate.Elevate the human racePutting makeup on my faceWe appreciate power (x2)Simulation, give me something goodGod’s creation, so misunderstoodPray to the divinity SO, WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE PRO-A.I.

Sigh, stare up at the ceiling fan and ponder the song as if it were a text? Or do what you do when some other tune catches you — flail your limbs, move your hips in weird little circles, bob your head rhythmically up and down? The world was built for pop songs: Public spaces pump the voices of stars through speakers the way air flows through ventilation ducts, and that sweet, consistent flavor — like Diet Coke or pamplemousse LaCroix — pairs easily enough with any modern pastime. But if the territory of pop music is everywhere, how and where does a piece of art pop — something equal parts challenging and engaging — make its home?Julia Holter, a Los Angeles-based artist with a background in composition, answers this question by creating otherworldly spaces in her own work. On her albums, medieval harmonies and insectlike synths enjamb; there’s a sense that what you’re hearing is very ancient and very modern at the same time, or even that those words no longer matter at all. This is the sort of world-building on display in Holter’s sixth studio L.P., “Aviary,” which takes its title from a line by the Lebanese-American writer Etel Adnan: “I found myself in an aviary full of shrieking birds.”From its opening — a cacophony of cymbals and anxiously pacing strings — the album is a study in creating a private dwelling place amid the chaos and uncertainty of the world. On one track it’s a place of emergency, with crisscrossing bagpipes and voice evoking a landscape pierced by unending sirens; on another it’s a dream, with a wintry, synth-heavy gloom giving way to hazy tenderness, like a Kate Bush song peered at through depth-obliterating fog. The worlds glimpsed here are varied, sometimes wildly so, but what they share is the sense that they are not so much depicting reality as taking inspiration from it, channeling familiar features into new forms.Out of this thicket of sound and confusion comes “I Shall Love 2,” a five-minute track that feels like stepping out of a dark forest that you’ve been wandering in a daze, into a clearing where you can feel the full strength of the sun. You may still be lost, but now there’s a real sense of liberation to it. Holter begins with a bare-voiced reading of a fragment from an old troubadour song — “That is all, that is all/there is nothing else” — followed by soft organ and a cantering, loping beat. There’s a lull that lasts far longer than you’d expect before Holter begins to murmur, low and private, as if musing to herself. The lyrics are a patchwork — lines borrowed from troubadour song and Dante’s “Inferno,” Holter’s own words — all unified by her agile delivery, which glides from that soothing murmur to a yelp to a torch song. One by one, new patterns and phrases are thrust into the space of the song, lingering and dissipating and overlapping, until they’ve become a joyous squall, a raucous flock of melody that’s ecstatic and ethereal and raw all at once.Holter, in other words, takes the garden path to catharsis, allowing something uplifting to emerge from the tumult, making chaos resolve itself into something humane and beautiful and full of intention. And she has found, even at music festivals and rock clubs, hushed and attentive audiences for this. (Much like her contemporaries Julianna Barwick or the Norwegian musician Jenny Hval, Holter’s music occupies that narrow margin of overlap between the stuff you listen to for pure enjoyment and the stuff you listen to for mental nourishment.) Her performances are absorbing: They highlight the organic beauty and authority of her voice, the way the meanings of words can be a sort of veneer over their untamed musicality. The music rewards more than just hearing it. It rewards some other kind of listening, asking you to let yourself become porous.And lately it can fill an appetite that seems both modern and primal at once: to make whole a fractured attention span, to find a ritual that works. Our days are full of tiny slivers of time that we offhandedly cram with music, filling the gaps between tasks and places like someone idly coloring in a picture. It’s satisfying to engage with sounds that won’t fit easily into those pre-existing slots, that dwell strangely in the everyday, transforming it, opening it up, urging you to conjure the imaginary, not-yet-existent space in which they might fit. Holter’s music is the opposite of filler: It’s a trap door leading to someplace that’s not your own.Alexandra Kleeman lives in Staten Island and is the author of the novel “You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine.”The pop star cedes the stage.By CHARLES AARONMaroon 5’s success contains multitudes. There may be no better example of this than the group’s pop-soul exhalation “Girls Like You,” which spent seven weeks last year atop Billboard’s Hot 100 and 33 weeks in the Top 10. Though the song began as a demo by the L.G.B.T. artist Starrah, about her own feelings for a female friend, it was then punched up and polished by a trio of gnomic writers and producers — Henry (Cirkut) Walter, Jason Evigan and Gian Stone — before the heavily compressed and reverbed track was spiced up with the most distinctive voice of the past year, that of Cardi B.These figures are not the ones who most make “Girls Like You” matter, though. Neither does Adam Levine (who gets a writing credit) or his happy-to-be-here sidemen who constitute the Maroon 5 touring entity. Nor do the boisterous Voice of Atlanta gospel choir and Equinox Percussion drum corps who enlivened the band’s performance of the song during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.These contributors all gave shape and solidity to Maroon 5’s vaporous cultural presence. But at a time when women and nonwhite men have been facing down the White House and law enforcement’s relentless disrespect with civic, public and artistic resolve, the most crucial multitude were the 26 female entertainers, athletes, politicians, activists and survivors who seized control of the song’s video, which was the most-watched clip of 2018, with 1.6 billion views.As the camera circles, Levine stands in the center of a soundstage, arms by his side, his voice skipping nimbly over the melody. He’s the ultimate embodiment of a stubbly, privileged white bro who belatedly realizes that he needs his partner. Coming from Levine, the song’s colloquial lyric seems to distill toxic masculinity and the exploitation of women’s emotional labor: “Maybe it’s 6:45/Maybe I’m barely alive/Maybe you’ve taken my shit for the last time, yeah/Maybe I know that I’m drunk/Maybe I know you’re the one/Maybe you’re thinking it’s better if you drive.”As the verse-chorus unfolds, Levine is joined one at a time, their backs to his back, by the 26 women. Dancing and exuding playful charisma, some acknowledge him; some don’t. Then, less than two minutes in, he suddenly disappears, as if ceding the spotlight. When Cardi B delivers her final flourish, he returns briefly, but by the end of the video, the soundstage is occupied by only the women.Adam Levine is to a rock star as a 2019 rock star is to a 2019 rapper. In other words, he ain’t it. Rather, he’s the genial tattooed tycoon who craves cooler and edgier friends but just can’t seem to make it happen. At 39, he’s the shredded-abs dad bod that everybody has seen one too many times. But in the “Girls Like You” video, Levine owns all that. At least in this moment, he leaves the pocket T-shirt on, keeps the guitar in the closet and hands the mic to the long-suffering women who have chosen to support him. For the first time, maybe ever, he flashes some legit star-power potency.Charles Aaron is a writer in Durham, N.C.The new face of gangsta rap broadcasts his crimes and winds up in handcuffs.By WILLY STALEYThe first time I saw the video for Tekashi 6ix9ine’s “Gummo,” I felt a little bit like Rip Van Winkle wandering down from the Catskills. What in the world happened here? I was only gone for an hour! Some elements were familiar (a crew of guys in front of a brownstone, drinking and mugging for the camera), and some were menacing (the number of red bandannas and guns on display), but it was the man at the center of the video who startled me most; he seemed almost precision-engineered to make people feel old.He was screaming himself hoarse about robbing and shooting people, over a haunting, spare beat, but I’d heard that before — it was his appearance that shocked me. In an era when most young rappers have a couple of face tattoos, 6ix9ine had the number 69 inked above his right eye in 72-point type. He had the same number spelled out in cursive over his left eye. It was everywhere on his body. His scraggly hair was dyed ROYGBIV, and he had a grill to match. He looked like one of those frogs you’re not supposed to touch.Within about a year, he would be in federal custody, a 22-year-old facing life in prison for a number of charges, including racketeering and attempted murder. Law enforcement accused 6ix9ine and others in his circle of being members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and, under the RICO Act, charged them with participating in shootings and robberies all over New York City. Normally this sort of arrest leads to an outcry about literal-minded police overreach. Not this time. People generally seemed pleased to see the rapper in cuffs.This was partly because 6ix9ine was universally reviled by music critics and journalists, on account of a crime he committed before he became famous: In 2015, he pleaded guilty to the use of a minor in a sexual performance, for having filmed and shared on social media a video of a girl performing oral sex on his friend. But it was also because he had spent the past year living the life of a Looney Tunes character: courting danger, narrowly escaping it, then taunting his foes. This genuinely incredible run netted him more than 150 stories on TMZ: gang members in San Antonio threatening his life; a shootout at the Barclays Center; shots fired at a video shoot in Brooklyn; more shots fired at a Beverly Hills video set. Through it all, he posted on Instagram, usually wearing red, often handling bricks of cash, sometimes clutching extremely illegal-looking guns, but never betraying an ounce of concern for his well-being.[More on the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine.]Cultivating this sort of personal mythology is not at all new; it dates back to the earliest days of gangsta rap. Ever since Eazy-E bankrolled NWA with drug money, a certain proximity to criminality has been expected of certain rappers. If your music purports to document life on the other side of the law, then you better know what you’re talking about. Not long ago, rappers had just a few limited channels through which to prove that they did: lyrics, album art and, if they were famous enough, music videos. Like Old Testament gods, they willed whole universes into being through their words.Now they have social media. Case in point: On “Stoopid,” which came out last fall, 6ix9ine insults two rappers he was feuding with at the time, but unless you were listening for it, you probably wouldn’t have noticed. Much more memorable were the Instagram videos he made to antagonize the two; in one he took his rival’s former girlfriend and mother of his child out shopping.This sort of online mythmaking is second nature to SoundCloud rappers, so called for the streaming service that birthed the scene. SoundCloud rap is not characterized by a particular sound so much as its anarchic energy — the face tattoos, the prescription drugs, the orthographically complex handles. This scene has been alarmingly fecund and seems to accelerate evolution in disturbing directions, a little like Lake Springfield on “The Simpsons.” Even within this ecosystem, 6ix9ine stood out like a chumbox thumbnail — is he ... real?The problem, for 6ix9ine, was that a big part of his adopted persona, both on Instagram and in his music, involved being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. According to a Rolling Stone profile that came out after his arrest in November, this was essentially an act: Danny Hernandez, in the years leading up to his fame, had been a trollish and goofy Bushwick deli employee; his industry blacklisting had pushed him into the hands of an apparently gang-affiliated manager, who also provided him with a new edge. 6ix9ine is far from the only rapper to have ever made dubious claims to being a Blood, but Instagram has a way of making even the most absurd feints real. Maybe the whole thing really was a put-on, but also, he really did it. The Rolling Stone article recounts how, at his arraignment, the presiding judge asked the prosecution how it knew Hernandez was at real-life crime scenes. “The answer was often simple: Hernandez had posted about it on Instagram.”A liminal space has always existed between rappers and their personas. Sometimes it’s as thin as a fig leaf, but even then it’s essential, both legally and morally. The gap between 6ix9ine and Danny Hernandez was considerably wider, but he snapped it shut with his phone, merging fantasy with reality through a front-facing camera. Once intertwined on a criminal indictment, the two aren’t easily unwound. It was reported in February that 6ix9ine, who pleaded guilty, agreed to help prosecutors in their case against his co-defendants, hoping for leniency: a reduced sentence and possibly witness protection. But helping 6ix9ine disappear into some corner of America might prove difficult, and not just because of the tattoos.Willy Staley is a story editor for the magazine.Talking to the pop star about approaching life as if you’re seducing it.Interview by LAURA SNAPESIn 1993, the Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn turned 14 and finished middle school; then she signed a record deal. She has been making music ever since, starting with her 1995 debut album, “Robyn Is Here,” which netted her two Billboard Hot 100 singles. Her 2005 album, “Robyn,” cemented her as a beloved, idiosyncratic pop star and earned her a Grammy nomination. She released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010, which included some of her biggest hits — “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend.” Now, after a long gestation period, she has returned with a new album and single, “Honey.”You’ve described the making of this song as searching for a feeling. A feeling of healing from sadness and wanting to share that with the world and with myself — a sense of self-love, excitement, some kind of peace of mind. Like when your strength is coming back. I wanted to describe this feeling like when you’re super close to someone else’s skin, or when you’re falling asleep, or when you’ve taken a drug that’s starting to kick in — sensations that are pleasurable, where your body is reacting to something outside of you.I felt naïve because I thought it was about self-discovery, but a friend said, “No, it’s about oral sex!” It could be about oral sex, sure! Intimacy, definitely, but it could be with yourself. It doesn’t have to do with another person. In a way I think your analysis is probably the best one, because isn’t oral sex self-discovery? Any experience you have that will give you a new point in your scale of emotions will make any other experience richer because you have a new point of reference.Maybe it’s about elevating self-care to the level of eroticism? Not reserving that deep pleasure for a sexual sensation, but something you could experience day to day. Exactly! That’s exactly it. It’s like approaching life as if you’re seducing it. As if you’re seducing yourself, or the other person, or your work, or whatever. Intimacy in every little thing.How do you approach life as if you’re seducing it? I feel like I have to work for it every day. It’s like starting a little fire: You have to be so careful with it, not force it. You get it going and then you can use it and tend to it and start it back up again.Is your fire well tended? Not at all. I’m not in a great place at the moment, to be honest. It’s a good conversation for me to have, a good reminder. I maybe need to go back and listen to some of my songs myself to figure this out.[How Robyn, pop’s glittery rebel, danced her way back from darkness.]Your songs are known for intermingling sadness and euphoria. But “Honey” is less triumphant than that. I don’t think life is that easy anymore. I used to believe it would all make sense if you just powered through. I really don’t feel that way anymore at all. I think it’s pragmatic — I really don’t feel pessimistic.The idea of “self-care” can seem like a challenge. Post-recession capitalism has glorified the hustle so much. The society we live in at the moment — we didn’t really make it very good, you know? It’s really tough to take care of yourself. Self-care is difficult when you have a 9-to-5 job, and people are on Instagram projecting these images of themselves — we’re in a time where everyone’s engaged in storytelling in such an aggressive way. Stories are amazing — they’re part of what it is to be human — but you have to be aware they’re stories. That’s the problem with capitalism: It’s always trying to trick you into thinking there’s a purpose for all of this. But you can actually use a story that relates to something more real than buying yourself out of anxiety.It’s jarring to see people turning themselves into personal brands as part of that storytelling. That’s the strange thing about being an artist. There’s always a gap between how I see myself and how other people see me. When I was younger, I felt like it was easier for me to absorb other people’s thoughts about me, and more complex to understand what was me and what was other people, and how to respond to those expectations. I’m still learning that. I’ve been more specific with my expression on this album than I’ve been able to be before, but I’m aware that that doesn’t mean that people understand me. I don’t even know if that’s the point.A lot of today’s pop is about nihilism, depression, anxiety. There’s real sadness behind your album, too. It struck me as something that’s easy for the industry to exploit. Definitely: Pop at the moment is depressing. Hip-hop is really dark. The music kids are listening to is heavy! Maybe it’s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment, for a lot of young people — the number of voices that are trying to share this space in their brains is crazy. But maybe it’s cool that they get to explore their darkness as a collective earlier in life, because maybe it will also get them to the point where they’re letting go of it early as well.Is the industry set up for artists to be able to share their pain but protect themselves? It’s really difficult for anyone to not be exploited in our society as a whole. As an artist, you’re exposed, because you deal in emotions all the time. People want you to be vulnerable. If you think about sports — you look at it because someone’s pushing themselves to their limit. If you don’t risk anything, why would people want to see it happen?You turn 40 this June. You could listen to “Honey” as a celebration of the richness that comes with age, and maybe aging as a woman. I think it can be that, for sure. I’m not looking forward to being 40, to getting older. I know that’s not a very mature thing to say, but it is what it is.Laura Snapes is the deputy music editor of The Guardian.Devin Yalkin is a photographer from New York.This interview has been condensed and edited.Who knew that flamenco — and a medieval love-gone-wrong tale — could be so relevant?By MARTA BAUSELLSIt was hard to tell how many people in the club liked flamenco, an art form not much associated with young people anymore. But on New Year’s Eve in Barcelona, when the palmas hand claps that open Rosalía’s “Malamente” started pulsing from the speakers, looks of recognition flashed from face to face. And by the time Rosalía — an artist from the nearby town of Sant Esteve Sesrovires — started rapping, everyone was clapping along. Some of the younger girls even twerked.It’s not unheard-of for flamenco to make incursions into mainstream Spanish pop culture, but Rosalía is different. She sounds and feels cosmopolitan, cool in a sophisticated and almost foreign way. She doesn’t sound as if she’s playing just for us. And indeed, she isn’t: This two-and-a-half-minute song, with its balmy synth bass and irresistible syncopations and enticing whispers peppered throughout, has racked up more than 59 million views on YouTube. Her success, she has argued, is partly because of listeners’ weariness with the homogenization — which is to say, the Anglicization — of pop. Her own aesthetic is polished, globally recognizable, informed by hip-hop and trap music. But it’s also saturated with bullfighting and windmills and fire. Her sophomore album, “El Mal Querer” (which roughly translates as “loving badly”), is a conceptual project patterned on the subversive medieval text “Flamenca.” The last frames of the “Malamente” video feature a figure wearing the conical capirote hat worn by penitents during Holy Week — while also riding a skateboard.“Malamente”’s appearance in the club also seemed to inspire a few eye rolls. Maybe this is the price of success in a culture that looks askance at overt displays of ambition or self-actualization, especially by women. By New Year’s Eve, Rosalía had come up in every conversation I’d had for days — she was as interesting to my grandmother as she was to my 12-year-old cousin. The local fascination tended to focus less on her art and more on her as a phenomenon, on the extraordinary speed of her rise to stardom. It would spark arguments too, about cultural appropriation and the Romany community, who have always been closely associated with flamenco.“Malamente” means “badly,” and the story of “Flamenca” is not a happy one. A woman gets married to a man who later grows jealous and imprisons her. It’s not surprising, these days, that a global star would be singing about such suffering. But Rosalía reminds us that pain and possession are topics that have interested humans for centuries. Millions of her listeners must be enjoying this music without understanding the language, but right now, for me, it feels cathartic — soothing, even — to be able to stand in a crowd singing “badly, badly, so badly” while clapping my hands.Marta Bausells is a writer in London and Barcelona.The singer talks about what it costs us, having to do all that work.Interview by HAZEL CILLSLast fall, Marie Davidson, a French Canadian producer of electronic music, released “Work It,” an aggressively rattling track on which she serves “kind of like an M.C./personal trainer,” exhorting listeners not to dance but to work, constantly and sweatily, seven days a week. The song became a minor anthem, and the album it came from, “Working Class Woman,” was embraced as one of the best dance records of the year.What sort of place were you at in your life when you wrote this song? Obviously I was working a lot. I had already toured Europe and the U.S., and I was going back to Europe to play festivals. I wanted to make a banger to play live — I just picked up my microphone and started talking. The song came out in a funny way, but the undertone is serious.I don’t think all people should work all the time. It’s sarcastic, it’s humorous, but in the joke there’s also truth. It’s why I say, toward the end, that when I say “work,” you have to work for yourself, love yourself, feed yourself. Whatever you do, whatever amount of energy you put into something, you have to do it for yourself and not to please others. Not to build this facade or this persona or achievement.Do you think people base too much of their self-worth on their work? Absolutely. We live in a society that is based on work — goals, achievement, money. Of course! It’s a real problem — workaholism, exhaustion, burnout. We’re not taught in this society — it’s not valued — to take time and just learn to love yourself. You’re taught to be strong, to look smart, to be useful. But I think you become a much more useful person if you learn how to love yourself.Do you think people who aren’t musicians are aware of how physically taxing it can be? It would be hard to know. When you look at pictures or videos, it doesn’t look like that. It looks really fun and glamorous. And it is, sometimes, for a few hours. But it’s not a glamorous job being a touring musician. I still have people come up to me after a gig or somewhere, saying: “You’re so lucky. I wish I had your life.” And I’m like: What do you mean by that? Do you think I woke up one morning and became who I am? It’s years and years of work and trial and error. It’s a real job, like being a carpenter or being a designer.People think of the dance floor as this freeing space. But you’re kind of pointing out that this is just another workplace. For me, at least, it is. It used to be different. When I was 16 and I started going out in Montreal, going to underground parties and raves and clubs, it was magical. But it was different: I wasn’t working. It wasn’t my job. I was going there for fun. Even if I was playing, it was special. It wasn’t in the schedule, where you just do it over and over again. That space is now a work space for me. There’s no more leisure. I’ve sacrificed that freedom for other things. Now if I want to feel something mind-blowing or magical, I have to look for it outside of club culture. The music never loses its magic, but the social thing happening at a party or something like that? No.It sounds as though the song stemmed from your personal experience, but it feels universal. When I made it, I knew anyone could relate. Because this is the time we live in. Everything goes really fast now. People are expected to produce and achieve. It’s kind of sad, I think. There’s a rigidity in that mind-set about what you should be doing with your life. We’re ruled by capitalism, so that’s what we get. We are living comfortably, and people feel that they are free, but I don’t think that individuals are that free in society.So how do you make art under capitalism? I don’t care. When I’m in my studio composing music, I really don’t think about that — about what is the potential of that song, where is it going to take me, what does it mean to the world. I don’t care. I never did. I don’t think about my label or my manager or anybody. My insecurities come after, when it’s time to be in the world.Interview has been condensed and edited.Hazel Cills is the pop-culture reporter at Jezebel.The british singer-songwriter who turned homage into a signature style.By JONAH WEINERJames Blake was talking about shanzhai, a Chinese phrase that means, roughly, “knockoff,” and that stems from the time-honored tradition in Chinese art of apprentices’ mimicking their masters — “copying something until you can better it,” he said, “or if not better it, compete with it.”Blake, a Grammy-winning avant-gardist with an ear for pop, who has been playing the piano since he was about 6, has a long list of heroes whom he has studiously copied in pursuit of his own sound. Copying the virtuoso jazz-pianist Art Tatum, the protominimalist French composer Erik Satie and the midcentury gospel maestro the Rev. James Cleveland taught Blake novel ways of opening up complex chord structures and fitting them — to gorgeous, aching effect — around deceptively simple melodies. Copying singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder emboldened him to write and sing pop songs with increasing emotional candor. Copying the hip-hop producer Timbaland and the South London dubstep craftsman Mala informed Blake’s love of distorted timbres — electronic rhythms that skitter and twitch as often as they groove — and of sampling, a technique of literal copying (and cutting and pasting) so central to Blake’s practice today that, even when he isn’t sampling anyone else, he routinely samples himself. “I’ll sit at a piano, improvising” into a microphone, he explained, then search the tape for building blocks that he can pluck out and, with editing software, arrange into new compositions.Blake stands at an imposing 6-foot-6 and carries himself with the deliberateness of a man at risk of scraping his head on doorways. Early in February, in a wood-paneled rehearsal space in the Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles, he sat at a Prophet ’08 synthesizer opposite Rob McAndrews, a multi-instrumentalist, and Ben Assiter, a drummer, his longtime friends and touring bandmates. At their feet, black cables snaked and cloverleafed among clusters of red-, blue-, silver- and cream-colored effects pedals, like tracks connecting villages in a model-train set.Blake is from London, but three and a half years ago he began dating the British comedic actress Jameela Jamil, and when she booked a lead role on the NBC sitcom “The Good Place,” he tagged along with her to California. Now Blake led McAndrews and Assiter through a practice run of “I’ll Come Too,” a swooning new song about joining Jamil out west — about that moment when you want to follow a crush anywhere. The song comes from his fourth LP, “Assume Form,” which was released in January. “That’s a fun one to play,” he said when they finished. “I really like it. But it’s hard — I’m singing all the way through, in all these different ranges, and I don’t get a chance to breathe. When I recorded it, I broke the vocal up.”The extent to which Blake has digested the lessons of his musical heroes is illustrated not only by his decade-spanning run of singles, EPs and albums but also by the number of pop auteurs who have collaborated with him. Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, André 3000 and Travis Scott are among those artists who have enlisted Blake’s assistance. As an influence and a collaborator, Blake has helped shape two of the more striking trends in contemporary pop: beats that mutate over the course of a song, resisting any traditionally identifiable center, and an emotional atmosphere in which the line between hedonism and melancholy, bliss and despair comes undone.His influence extends even to artists he hasn’t worked with directly. In 2011, I visited Drake — a pop giant whose entire musical project has been about smudging the line between hedonism and melancholy — at a converted Toronto warehouse, where he was working on his second album with his musical right hand, the producer known as 40. The room was free of decoration save for 40’s copy of Blake’s debut LP, perched on a windowsill like a talisman. Drake later sampled unreleased music of Blake’s on a single called “0 to 100/The Catch Up.” Blake, who hadn’t approved this usage, got his part removed. At the start of his career, Blake told me, he’d been a solitary, “solipsistic” bedroom producer. “I was so protective of my ideas — so militantly and obsessively protective,” he explained, that it wasn’t until years later, when “I found personal openness, for maybe the first time in my life, that I found collaborative openness, too.”“Assume Form” is an album expressly about getting out of one’s skull. Five-odd years ago, Blake suffered from a depression so severe that he considered suicide. “Assume Form” chronicles his escape from that depression, and its title track, which leads the album, plays like a statement of purpose. Blake described it to me as “a song about intimacy — about feeling like you don’t deserve intimacy and feeling like there’s no way somebody could really want it with you.” The song’s themes are sex, shame and — by the end — happiness. “It’s by far the most vulnerable, exposed song on the entire record,” Blake said. “It’s saying, If you’re comfortable with this, then the bar has been set.”Blake was two and a half weeks into rehearsals for a tour that would take him around the country and then around the world. He and his band manned a variety of instruments, mostly electronic: the Prophet ’08; a large, modular synthesizer, studded with knobs, plugs and blinking lights, which McAndrews operated; and a rubber-covered pad, nestled between cymbals and high-hats, that Assiter thwacked with drumsticks to trigger pulses and prerecorded percussive sounds. Translating and arranging Blake’s intricate studio creations for live concerts is a tricky task made trickier still by his refusal to use a laptop. “With live electronic music, I’ve seen the man-checking-emails situation so many times,” Blake said, referring to that category of lackluster performance in which artists stand unbudgingly at MacBooks, pecking at keys. “I want an audience member to see what’s happening. So if Ben is playing the kick and Rob is over here fiddling with knobs and it’s clear that what he’s doing is changing the sound, then it makes sense.”The trio consulted a whiteboard upon which the new album’s dozen songs were listed. “Should we try ‘Assume Form?’” Assiter asked. Blake furrowed his brow. The new album’s title track is, structurally speaking, strange. As its lyrics switch between optimistic vows of commitment and confessions of insecurity, this duality is echoed in the music, which consists of two alternating piano motifs — one shimmering, the other overcast. The track began as a long, meandering improvisation from which Blake eventually sampled two disparate chunks, putting them into jarring conversation. When I asked Blake to explain the harmonic unease between these two parts, he replied: “The song essentially modulates from D major in the first section to B flat in the second, which are unrelated keys. The first section has the tonic as the bass note, which gives it this firmly rooted presence, whereas the other section has the third in the bass, which makes it feel suspended — which is when the lyrics turn to self-doubt.” He thought for a moment. “It’s quite an odd pairing. It doesn’t work, musically. But there’s a harmony there. Joni Mitchell does something similar on ‘My Old Man,’ where it goes into a minor key when she sings, ‘But when he’s gone. ...’” Complicating things further, Blake’s piano playing on the track was “loose — like, microseconds” offbeat, he said, which would add yet another layer of difficulty when it came to replicating “Assume Form” live. “Let’s try something else,” he told Assiter.Blake was raised by his father, James Litherland, a singer-songwriter and guitarist with a prog-rock pedigree, and his mother, a graphic designer and cycling instructor, in Enfield, a North London suburb. He described his life from adolescence on as largely unhappy, warm and supportive parents notwithstanding. “I had anger,” he said. “A lot of it.” As a teenager, “I had terrible acne, and now I think it was a physical presentation of how angry I was.” What angered him? “My treatment by other people,” he said. “People I’d been open with. Romantic and personal betrayals. And just a feeling of persecution. I didn’t fit in, and I resented not fitting in. I had a couple friends outside of school, so I wasn’t totally alone, but I remember years of sitting by myself at lunch. Or just going home because I didn’t want to suffer in public.” Rather than getting out this anger, he repressed it. “As a child I was very open and emotionally vulnerable and said how I felt,” he recalled. “And I sort of had that beaten out of me — not physically but emotionally. At school, and in British society, there was this sense of, if you don’t behave in the right way — if you’re not coolheaded — then people punish you for that. So that was my childhood, that reflex being stamped out of me. And it stayed with me well into my 20s.”Instead, Blake said, music “started to be my first language” and “talking about how I felt was second or third.” In 2007 he enrolled in the Popular Music program at Goldsmiths University of London. As important as his classes were the nighttime excursions he took to clubs like Plastic People and Mass. There, Blake discovered a community of producers and D.J.s — black, white, “from all parts of London,” he said — who were busy hashing out the oblong dimensions of dubstep, a new kind of dance music defined by cavernous reverb, sinister drones and deceptively complex rhythms in which growlingly deep bass lines were the primary propellant. Whereas an amped-up version of dubstep soon grew into a global phenomenon, throbbing in GoPro commercials and glitzy Las Vegas clubs, it was more subtle in its dynamics at first. Its architects assumed gnomic pseudonyms like Coki, Skream and Loefah and tended to direct attention away from themselves and toward the dance floor. “You can imagine how that appealed to me at the time,” Blake said.On small but influential labels, he began releasing his own dubstep-inspired songs marked by his sophisticated harmonic sense. Initially he sampled other people’s vocals, but later he began singing himself. Blake eventually became comfortable enough to let his voice — a lovely, quaking baritone — ring out clearly, but at first he distorted it self-protectively: “I intentionally disembodied my voice,” he said, explaining that “there’s a safety in alteration, because it no longer has to represent the natural resonance that came out of your chest.”In 2011, his debut album, “James Blake,” was shortlisted alongside releases by Adele and P.J. Harvey for Britain’s prestigious Mercury Prize. The album’s fans included Bjork, who attended Blake’s concerts; Thom Yorke, who dropped Blake’s songs into D.J. mixes; and Brian Eno and RZA, who collaborated with Blake on “Overgrown” (2013), which was also shortlisted for a Mercury (this time he won). Success didn’t cure Blake’s long-seething unhappiness, however. Around this time, he told me: “I was at home, playing PS4 and smoking weed, which I’d been doing a lot, and I started to have these hallucinations of black. The screen stopped being the game and started being the void. I had physical tremors and panic attacks and had to go to my room and just lie there. I started saying things like, What’s the point? What’s the point of me?”He was having trouble writing new music, which inspired an existential dread in him. He remembered thinking, That’s my only expression as a human being, so I may as well not be here. He never took concrete steps to kill himself, he said, “but I was thinking about it a lot. Thinking about nothingness. I was just despondent. It didn’t matter to me whether I was here or not. So I was at that point. And I was caught just in time.”It was Jamil who caught him — she, more than anyone else in his life, Blake said, helped him to break free of his self-destructive tendencies, prodding him to speak up when he grew sullen and requiring complete emotional transparency. “Nothing else will do,” he said. “In a relationship, something rots unless there’s full disclosure.” He also saw a therapist specializing in a technique known as eye-movement desensitization reprocessing, or E.M.D.R., in which a patient recalls unhappy memories while moving the eyes back and forth rapidly and tapping the hands in time — reconfiguring a relationship to past traumas, in effect, by setting them to a beat.Blake’s default mode on “Assume Form,” which he calls “essentially a pop album,” is one you might call cautious euphoria. It is also the most collaborative thing he has put out, featuring guest production from the Atlanta-based hip-hop luminary Metro Boomin and a series of duets with stars like Travis Scott, André 3000 and the breakout Catalan singer Rosalía. It would be important, Blake said, when playing these songs live, to carve out room for improvisatory runs. “After seven shows, you almost feel like you’re on rails, and I hate that,” he said. “Feeling like I don’t have a choice. With tours you’re already so tightly scheduled in all other regards, that’s when I start to get anxious, feeling like I’m locked in.”The band moved next to a song called “Where’s the Catch,” on which Blake and André 3000 sing and rap, respectively, about what Blake characterized as “a distrust of really great things: ‘Everything’s seemingly nice — for today. But what’s around the corner?’” Rather than play André’s verse all the way through at concerts, the band intended to chop up his vocals and distribute them across the track in stuttering bursts. As they rehearsed the song, Blake’s vocals, too, were chopped up and fed through McAndrews’s synthesizer, where he warped them even further. The trio rode out the song with a jam session, adding layer after layer of noise on their way to a squalling crescendo. Blake’s vocals grew increasingly refracted and spectral, and there was something both frightening and exhilarating about the sound of the electronics swallowing him up whole.Jonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

This is the track with contemporary relevance that you’re looking for. You will consider it a statement that mimics the nonstop rattle of social media and the slow drip of Trump-era anxiety. The song, though, is decidedly less subtle than the wave of Obi-Wan Kenobi’s hand: Matty Healy, the gregarious lead singer of the English pop-rock band the 1975, delivers his litany of contemporary pop-culture references in an impassioned emo-dude howl, over an unchanging and relentless synth-pop stomp that sounds like New Order paying homage to the Fall. Donald Trump, Kanye West, Eric Garner, Lil Peep, the failures of modernity, the ubiquity of fake news, Healy’s own heroin addiction — it’s all accounted for with the maniacal thoroughness of Billy Joel straining to rhyme “Zhou Enlai” with “Bridge on the River Kwai.”But “Love It if We Made It” no longer makes me think about the Sturm und Drang of right now, or about millennials, or about being extremely online. It makes me think of one of the most popular rock bands of the ’70s and ’80s.I blame “Bohemian Rhapsody.” It’s tempting to view the runaway box-office success of the Freddie Mercury biopic — with a worldwide gross of $860 million and counting, it’s the most popular film about a real-life musician ever made — as an indication that the public yearns for the return of bands that will (stomp) will (stomp) rock you (clap). But overt revival acts — like the popular Michigan act Greta Van Fleet, whose members all dress exactly as Brian May did in 1973 — tend not to sonically resemble Queen beyond its first single, the quicksilver Led Zeppelin nod “Keep Yourself Alive.” No, the contemporary band that comes closest to emulating Queen’s whole legacy — as a shameless polymath pop act, willing to try anything, including but not remotely limited to metal, disco, rockabilly, theatrical English music-hall, folk, synth-pop and power ballads that turn unexpectedly into mock-opera freakouts — is the 1975. (Perhaps Greta Van Fleet should have called themselves the 1973.)Here’s a scene that’s not in “Bohemian Rhapsody”: In 1978, while making Queen’s seventh album, “Jazz,” Freddie Mercury was inspired to write his own litany-of-pop-culture-references song. He decided that “Jaws” wasn’t his scene, and he didn’t like “Star Wars.” He was also skeptical of God, Peter Pan, Frankenstein and Superman, but staunchly pro-drugs. There was no such thing as logging off back then, so his symbol of freedom and release was an old-fashioned one: bicycling. “I want to ride it where I like,” Mercury sang, as always committed to nothing else above his own liberation. “Bicycle Race,” a worldwide hit, is a perfect example of how Queen routinely violated one of the central truisms of rock, later articulated by David St. Hubbins in the 1984 film “This Is Spinal Tap” — “It’s such a fine line between stupid and clever.” The implication is that striving for transcendence is admirable, but it can easily embarrass you.[Can a quote-unquote band drag rock into the future? The 1975 is trying its hardest.]For Mercury and his bandmates, there was no line between stupid and clever; in many of the best Queen songs, stupid is clever. It takes a special kind of fearlessness to write songs about killer queens who are dynamite with laser beams, or fat-bottomed girls who make the rocking world go ’round, or really fast cars that you might want to have sex with. Part of the thrill of listening to Queen is hearing them get away with this sublime silliness, again and again.The 1975 have a similar inclination, in the words of Spin magazine, “to look and sound ridiculous.” When the band made its debut on “Saturday Night Live” in 2016, Healy pulled out every conceivable louche rock-singer move — he wore leather pants with no shirt, he tousled his curly black Sideshow Bob mane, he stuck out his tongue, he thrust his crotch like Tom Jones serenading an audience of divorcées. And yet there’s an ongoing debate as to whether the 1975 should even be considered a “real” rock band at all. Its third album, “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,” is its most willfully diffuse yet, touching on bedroom R.&B., jazzy torch songs, SoundCloud rap, ambient music and lots of other genres that a “smarter,” more conservative band would never dream of dabbling in. Last year, when pressed by Pitchfork to explain “Love It if We Made It,” Healy posed a delectable stupid-clever rhetorical: “How weird is reality?”The 1975 polarizes indie-rock fans — a bloc never comfortable with ostentatious displays of self-valorization — but detractors and admirers alike agree on this band’s utter absurdity. There may be no other way for a proper rock band to act. At a time when our lives are on display like never before, putting us all on the razor’s edge of life-changing public shame, how exhilarating is it to see people insist on riding where they like?Steven Hyden is the cultural critic for Uproxx and the author of “Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock.”Growing up means seeing heroes age, rudely, at the same pace as you.By LYDIA KIESLINGIn one episode of “The Office,” Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell) puts together a video called “Lazy Scranton” to welcome new employees to his branch. In keeping with his character’s genius for mangling pop-culture references, the video is Michael’s misguided stab at parodying the viral “S.N.L.” digital short “Lazy Sunday,” wherein Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell rap about getting cupcakes and going to see “The Chronicles of Narnia.” Michael’s version, which includes lines like “Call poison control if you’re bit by a spider/But check that it’s covered by your health care provider!” leaves the new employees stone-faced. When one of them quits, Michael pleads with him. “Didn’t you think ‘Lazy Scranton’ was funny?” “No,” the employee says. “Was it supposed to be funny?”I thought about this moment when I heard “Can’t Knock the Hustle,” a song Weezer released late last year. The track, a reimagining of Jay-Z’s song by the same title, is the marquee single from the band’s “Black Album.” I first heard Weezer’s version while driving a car, and I almost had to pull over. “What is happening?” I asked.The Jay-Z original is about selling drugs, with lines like “At my arraignment screaming/All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even/Thieving, as long as I’m breathing,” with a chorus sung by Mary J. Blige. The Weezer interpretation is about the gig economy and unspools in painfully dorky lines like “I’m an ugly [expletive] but I work hella harder/And you can write a blog about it” and “Leave a five-star review and I’ll leave you one too.” The song is unnervingly, relentlessly bouncy. In the video, Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy plays a beleaguered ride-share driver. “What is happening?” his face seems to say.Earlier this year, the band released an album of actual covers (“No Scrubs,” “Paranoid” and “Africa,” among others), none of which had the overwhelmingly depressing effect of “Can’t Knock the Hustle.” What is happening with this song? There’s the peculiar comic engagement with the desperate race to the bottom for American employers. There’s the white appropriation of black art, a refraction of hip-hop tropes that is about one thousand times less successful than “Lazy Sunday” (possibly even “Lazy Scranton”). And there’s the growing-old phenomenon of seeing former heroes make choices you don’t understand, in a way that makes you grapple with all your own previous choices.I have to acknowledge that I may be taking “Can’t Knock the Hustle” personally to an unreasonable degree. Weezer is a band with a fanatical but divided fan base, much of which believes that the band went downhill after its second album, “Pinkerton” (there’s even an “S.N.L.” skit about this schism). I’m a Weezer fan who considers her soul to have been irrevocably altered by “The Blue Album,” the band’s first, which was big guitars, big harmonization, big falsettos, big emotions. It can still conjure sense memories of decades past — windows down, crooning out into the forgiving dusk. Then there was “Pinkerton,” which had, in addition to its big guitars and emotions, big weirdness about gender and race. I look back on my 18-year-old self belting out lines like “You are 18-year-old girl who live in small city of Japan,” and have, if not regrets, questions. “Pinkerton” now seems like a raw, risky, sometimes repellent work of art, but one that earned its place in the age-old conversation about what is permitted by the artist.“Can’t Knock the Hustle,” on the other hand, sounds like an insincere effort to start a conversation that nobody wants to have, or at least that nobody wants to have with Weezer. The band’s recent spate of covers, even the ones that rise to the level of “fun curiosity,” feel like another race to the bottom in a cultural economy where attention matters more than anything else. (“Was it supposed to be funny?” I hear the new employee ask.)It’s not Weezer’s fault that I can’t let go of the past, but getting older is hard enough without Weezer making you feel it so acutely. “Can’t Knock the Hustle” fills me with a vague, general regret and an apprehension for what’s to come. As the song itself portends: “The future’s so bright I gotta poke my eyes out.”Lydia Kiesling is the author of the novel “The Golden State.”What do you do when you can’t put off the future any more?By RYAN BRADLEYA few years ago, Sharon Van Etten was interviewing another musician — Mimi Parker, from the band Low — on the NPR program “All Songs Considered.” Van Etten, then in her mid-30s, was thinking about having a kid and wanted to ask Parker, a mother of two, about what it would be like to be a mom and a touring musician at the same time.“My music is the center of my world,” Van Etten said while setting up a very big question: How does someone — anyone, but especially an artist — make room in her life for her work, when her work might no longer be the center of her world?“You just figure it out,” Parker answered.In the years that followed, Van Etten fell in love, pulled back from touring, enrolled in school to study psychology, was cast for an acting part in the Netflix show “The OA,” wrote a movie score, gave birth (a boy, now 2) — and in January released a new album, her first since 2014.The album’s title — “Remind Me Tomorrow” — comes from an Apple computer software-update alert option that Van Etten found herself selecting again and again, a perpetual prompt for something she needed to do and never quite got done. It’s a tidy summation of motherhood and artistry and the process of figuring them out, often at the same time, because, well, a lot of the figuring out seems to be figuring out what can wait until tomorrow.[Read about the many lives of Sharon Van Etten.]The album’s cover is another reflection of (or on) this conflict: a photo of a room with two toddlers in it, their stuff — toys, clothing, everything — spilled out around them. The image comes from the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann. (It was Dieckmann’s film “Strange Weather” that Van Etten scored.) Those are Dieckmann’s kids amid the chaos. Van Etten recalled in a Vanity Fair interview that when she told Dieckmann she was pregnant and worried about how she was going to make motherhood work, Dieckmann pulled out her phone and pulled up the photo. “You’ll figure it out,” she said.“Remind Me Tomorrow” is about all the stuff that can’t be KonMari’d out of existence: life, love, the figuring, the delaying, and the fact that eventually, one day, but probably not today, the time will come to finally do the all those things the “remind me tomorrow” prompts had so imperfectly kept at bay.The standout track, the song you want to raise up your fists and loosen your hips to, is “Comeback Kid.” It’s driving, then sweet, and it’s very stripped down. Every minor variation of the refrain seems to offer a new perspective. Sometimes when she sings it, Van Etten seems to be talking to an earlier version of herself, “Come back, kid!” Other times, she’s talking about someone who is definitely not her: the comeback kid. In the video, Van Etten stands singing as old photos are projected onto her face and body and the wall behind her. The photos are from Van Etten’s past, but there’s very little that’s specific about them. They just look like the past in general. Which is probably the point: The past can be both particular and general, as her decision to use cover art featuring someone else’s kids might indicate.“Comeback Kid” is a song about glancing at our past selves while dealing with the whole jumble of conflicting emotions that looking too closely at our past might dredge up. But mostly, it’s about the looking itself. It’s the looking that’s important. The world shifts; you look at the past; you look at the future. And then what do you do? You figure it out.Ryan Bradley is a writer in Los Angeles.A saxophone, a tuba and two drum kits combine to create a piece of music that somehow captures the whole history of jazz.By MARK RICHARDSONListen closely to the third track from the 2018 studio album “Your Queen Is a Reptile,” by the London jazz outfit Sons of Kemet, and you will hear a tenor saxophone, a tuba and two drummers, all moving at great speed. The whole operation sounds like four people piled into a wagon tumbling down a hill, just barely in control. Each element contributes equally. Because the bass comes from an instrument powered by breath, the darting low end is less of a woofer-pumping presence and more of a song-within-a-song, a melody that you can hum on its own. The saxophone shouts back, offering growling rhythmic lines with just a pinch of melody. And the dueling drummers build one intensely syncopated beat from parts of several — the foundational Caribbean rhythm of the Cuban tresillo, martial snare rolls, pinging metallic percussion reminiscent of the roaring Afrobeat of Fela Kuti. Listen without knowing another thing about it, and this is a viscerally overwhelming piece of music.Widen the focus, though, and you will learn that the song is called “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman,” and that each song title on the album references a heroic black woman who has inspired the band’s leader, the London-born, Barbados-raised saxophone player Shabaka Hutchings. Maybe that knowledge gives the burning intensity of the song — its feeling of joy streaked with struggle — a new dimension. Pull back further and take in Hutchings’s place as a central figure of one of this era’s most remarkable music scenes, sometimes called New London Jazz — an approach that incorporates sounds and styles from all over the African diaspora, along with locally sourced ingredients from the British electronic underground. Let even more into the frame — say, that Hutchings has performed with the Sun Ra Arkestra and is now signed to Impulse!, the imprint that issued major works from artists including John Coltrane, Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders — and then listen again to situate this music within the entire sweep of recorded jazz over the last 100 years.All this history is carried inside the song and transmitted by these master musicians thorough their instruments. It’s a sax, a tuba and two drum kits. It’s a tune and an unforgettable beat. It’s a call to action and a command to find the dance floor. It’s a deeply political piece of music that says a great deal without uttering a word. It’s music of this exact moment, built from sounds that have bounced back and forth across the Atlantic over centuries. Sounds that landed here, in a song honoring a woman whose face will, perhaps, on some future Sons of Kemet tour across the United States, be found on a $20 bill in Hutchings’s pocket, a queen’s visage replacing that of the dead president so admired by the current one.Mark Richardson is the former executive editor of Pitchfork and a writer and an editor in Brooklyn.Advertisement"
